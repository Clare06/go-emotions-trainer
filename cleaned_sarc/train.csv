Credit lending to play pretend rich because of social media pressures that's started since the internet as we compare ourselves with people outside our own towns. 
The government and big wigs are lining each others pockets while we sit defeated and tired in front of the goggle box with our microwave meals because the work life balance never shifted back post war.
Both sides of the argument considered there, we cannot compete with China and India for growth because we have more rules and regulations to protect us from predatory companies forcing the unemployed into extremely depressing production factories like the ones in China with suicide nets. 
Before anyone gets high and mighty, ask yourself what are you doing to make your country better? All I see is litter and too many cars and not enough respect for each other as we push and shove back to our little castles."

No one was claiming that a wage price spiral caused our current inflation crisis, the actions of the RBA and commentary about it was in order to prevent a wage price from occurring.
Now it seems like the RBA was largely successful in avoiding that outcome (although wages are contributing to the stickiness of services inflation), Jericho claims this as vindication.
It's like the morons who claimed GFC stimulus payments were a waste of money because we didn't have a recession in Australia. Unable (or unwilling) to understand counterfactuals or when policy actions were successful in meeting their aims."

The parking ,0,"Very surprised and disappointed upon arrival compared to what you read on the internet. The parking is located offsite which feels very unsafe due to unhoused neighbours. Once you finally make the 5-10 minute walk back to the hotel, it is another 10 minutes to your room. When you have severe asthma this is not ideal. I wish the parking situation was a lot more clear at the point of check out. I would have reconsidered the location. In the event of an emergency( fire) the never ending corridors and stairs you never be able to get out of the building! The evacuation plans located in the room are very hard to understand. Both bed side lamps are faulty and almost zapped me when I turned the first one on. To top it all off 2 x dogs are located in the apartment below which bark every time you go out on the balcony. Not the 5 star stay I was hoping for. The room however is large and clean and the best part of the whole experience. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone. For the price you pay and rating it has on other websites I am incredibly disappointed."

Food is reasonable, Chicken Biryani and Beef Nihari were of good taste and the portion size was decent too, but they serve in open pots with no lid so food gets cold quickly. Also, not sure it they use too much turmeric in biryani or it was some cheap food colour that left pretty stubborn yellow stains on my fingers and nails( I eat using my hand following Sunnah). They have a sign on till saying they take cash only, but you can do bank transfer to them as well. They have floor sitting I think for families as they have curtains but they are useless being see through and across the tables, so it is an awkward view especially with family if you using floor seating and people sitting on chair oppsite to you side stare at you directly due to the position of seatings."

I came as a free guest of a member( my partner) today during a promotion and did two classes, went for a run and then had a swim and steam. The whole experience is fantastic. It very costly though to be a member. If you have the cash to spare, then it worth it. My partner enjoys it and all the staff are super friendly and remembered his name or previous chats and that makes you feel special. My only criticism is that the sealant in the showers needed replacing and the showers needed a bit of a scrub but that could easily be sorted. It been heavily used today on member guest day. Anyone can use the bar so I definitely be back for lunch and a highly recommended green smoothie. Thanks for a lovely afternoon. I loved it!"

The food was fantastic and the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful. I would definitely eat here again. My only issue was the price, which seemed to range between 25 to 60 per meal. It's hard enough to get a babysitter for kids and get out of the house for a wonderful dinner, I just wish the prices were kinder to the old bank balance."

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.
Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.
The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.
Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit 3 trillion. (3,000,000,000,000).
It was about 1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.
If anyone is interested, i am setting up a petition to deport the Conservative party to Rwanda, it probably won't happen, but it will give the civil service a laugh.

My petition:
Deport the entire Conservative party to Rwanda.

We had lots of fun, it's great pool with a good wave machine, bubbles and two brilliant flumes. The flumes are definitely the best part, they're probably the best slides we've ever been on together, they're both very long and fast. It was also nice and warm inside despite being January and very chilly outside. Overall it's a fantastic place to come swimming with the family, it would be 5 stars although some of lockers were damaged and there are n't many family changing cubicles so you have to queue up and wait for one to become available. The price was also very reasonable, only 15 for both of us, so I'd definitely recommend you visit if you're looking for a fun place to go swimming with the family."

I didn't own the truck obviously. I'm just a guy working towards my truck license. I'm also not a youngster - just decided I'd like to have a truck license since occasionally I've wished I had one.
Honestly, I'd expect someone young to be the most likely to actually have a use for a big truck. They almost certainly don't have enough disposable income have a vehicle like that just because it looks cool. Some people do put cargo in the back of their truck regularly. And those big RAMS can carry a lot more weight than a 2WD Hilux.
I've driven a 2WD hilux fully loaded with a trailer... it was not fun. I had the accelerator pedal on the floor for about an hour and even down hill it only reached 90km/h - the wind resistance alone was more than the tiny motor could handle, let alone the weight which would've been about half a ton in the tray and another ton on the trailer. It was safe, the suspension and brakes could totally handle the weight. But the motor? Fuck me that thing wasn't good enough. Also that one hour drive used half a tank of petrol  motors are only efficient when they're not working too hard. If you do move heavy / large things regularly, you want a large motor."

This is just a distraction. Nuclear might have been a good option 30 years ago but not today. We in Australia have a very unique opportunity to harness the sun, wind and the ocean.

Breakfast the first morning was something to be desired.... But this was due to a different chef on, as the following morning it was lovely. We had dinner in the bar downstairs, the food was lovely and we were entitled to 2 courses from the menu in with our room deal, though no atmosphere to stick around. All in all it was a fab offer though. The quaint village is 10 mins walk away if you want pubs, cobbled streets, and a good atmosphere."

So you are a human survivor of a long line of humans so far, either we innovate and adapt or die out as another also ran. This year the average has broken 1.5 deg and accelerating. Forget about party politics and consider what can be done quickly - with or without the support of the freemarket practioners - because they have done us so well so far - the desperate circumstance of no new gas will stimulate the directed research that will develop substitute feed stocks and the chemistry to go with it. We are human and able to adapt if we follow the science , not the personal interests of todays gas investors."

It was a Saturday evening and yet there were only 3 people in the entire pub and it was dead quiet. A pint is around here. The pub itself is clean and tidy but it was like being in the 1980s. After the first pint, the other 3 lads left and I decided to leave meaning that there was nobody in here despite it being a Saturday evening. I do n't know how The Leeds manages to stay open if they get no customers but I take my hat off to them for staying open. Going there was certainly an experience."

Wonder too whether part of this is the beer market kind of losing touch with the consumer. There's an expectation that every bar will carry a super diverse range of high end/craft beers, but everyone's still expecting to pay Carlton Draft prices. Dunno about linking Tetsuya's closure to this though, pretty sure a big part of that was the skyrocketing value of the land under Tetsuya's."

Probably because they are incapable or simply opposed to the idea. The last good idea a government had was the NBN, and the succeeding government successfully managed to wreck it.
Just have a look at the current state of power in this country. It's absolutely chaotic. They've had decades to figure it out. And despite the fact it's bordering an actual emergency now they still have no plans.
Same issue with regards to housing, education, healthcare etc. The government's forecast extends only tk the next election. And, unfortunately, this is precisely what many voters want."

However, the food is delicious and beautifully presented. The food is served quite fast, and the dining area is quite spacious too. Although with many people in there, I do n't have to speak loudly to be heard, it actually a nice place for catching up. The only downside is that only one person takes your order, so you might need to wait before you can place your order."

Establishments that segragate an ddivide societies based on religion have no place in a modern world.  Catholics here, CofE there, other Potestants there, Muslims somewhere else, Jewish children in their own schools etc... I can not believe that this is tolerated in today's world after literally thousands of years of experience showing us what religion does to inflame and instigate grief, ignorance and violence.
If your religion is so important to you then send you children to after school classes.  Your beliefs should not impinge on my freedom to be educated undisturbed, on teachers' abilities to teach or on schools' abilities to teach.  Why should 90% of society move over every time someone says their ""faith"" means they need to interrupt?  If every religious minority did this society would simply grind to a halt.  Civilised society depends on everyone compromising in the face of facts not beliefs.  Your beliefs doe not trump my facts.

With the venue, some of the earthy woodwork could do with a polished stain, but that is just my preference, as it just looks like it has been quickly slapped together. That is just my perfectionism. The bar area with the lights set the feeling of something special in a relaxed greek island vibe. The staff are prompt and professional. Most of all, it looks clean, and food handling practice excellent. Music is not too loud thankfully. Ca n't wait to see the vegetarian and sweets menu that is apparently coming in the near future. Highly recommend. Such a pleasure talking to Andrew too."

Oh, look, police being bastards. How utterly out of character.
Bullshit. 9/10 times, the cops don't disclose because they know they fucked up. And when they do disclose, it's always swept up as quickly and cleanly as possible. They see us as the enemy. Police culture is infested with this ""us vs. them"" mentality.
Fun fact -NSWPOL still has senior officers involved in Sydneys gay bashing epidemic on the force. 
Fun fact 2 - NSWPOL can't stop itself from abusing its powers to strip search children.
The best thing NSW could do would be to redirect like 40% of the police's budget elsewhere. Fuck em."

But when did you get here? It wasn't always an employer's market. Pre-covid, at least in hospitality, casual workers could leave bad work environments because they had a lot more options. Post-covid there are fewer customers, rosters are thin, and venues closing down means workers are competing for fewer jobs, and they stick around even when mistreated.
A lot of casual work is taken up by visa holders like yourself, who don't have a safety net and tend to be even more exploitable, so I'm not sure it's Australian workers who are tolerant.
I think the real question is why are exploitative employers hard to hold accountable? There's Fair Work but they seem to only go after big corporations. In Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland, there's JobWatch, but they've had funding massively cut last year.
Maybe you're asking why Australians don't care enough to fund organizations that support casual workers' rights. That's fair to call out."

Located at the top of Cambridge St, it is only round the corner from another Wetherspoons, the Wather Works. Benjamin Huntsman was notable for this steel producing town as he invented crucible or cast steel & he opened a plant in Sheffield around 1740. The building is rather interesting inside with itsl industrial elements & overly large pipework. Two coffee machines on the lower floor along with an accesible toilet located to the rear. Other toilets are on the second floor up a staircase-note at the time of visiting, the ladies toilets only flushed if you press both buttons at the same time.

Read this thread that details how they will sell you a ticket and probably never actually run the event and certainly never give you a refund.
The ""secret location"" will likely be an existing bar that has no idea they will be hosting the event. Attendees may show up on the day and the bartenders will be wondering WTF is going on.
The people behind this should be in jail.
Edit: It's possibly a different company that runs the one in the OP. Be cautious anyway."

It's takes a lot of cups of coffee to pay those bills.  The staff are barely making a living wage.  The whole industry is struggling.

Our first impression was how heavy the sli",1,"My brother took me here for lunch, which was nice of him. Our first impression was how heavy the sliding entry door was. It took 15 men and a small goat to tow it open with a rope. Once inside, the waitress seated us at our table, which was in the middle of the room. This would n't be unusual except we were the only two customers in the restaurant, aside from some rando in shorts at the bar, who left soon after. The decor is nice. The waitress served our table water, took our orders, then went and made our drinks. The food seemed to take a while, which I thought was odd considering the number of people they had to serve( 2, us). I guess the kitchen staff just had to catch up on whatever the kardashians were doing or whatever. No complaints about the food or drinks when they finally came. Top tier, served and presented well and tasted better than it looked. About the best a bundy bogan can ask for. The waitress serving us( the only waitress there) also made our cocktails. She took pride in crafting the unique house specials they offered, which, as somewhat of a mixologist myself, I could appreciate. Overall, I had a pleasant dining experience, and I would definitely come here again on someone else money. Between entrees, mains, and drinks, we racked up 240, although we were given 4 back in change for some unknown reason. It was really mysterious. Another mystery was what was upstairs. They had chairs parked in front, so you could n't easily get up there, but I think next time, I will try and sneak up there and uncover whatever secrets they are hiding."

Tables were recently reclothed( which is great) but what is not so great is the table maintenance. Tables are always very dirty and it seems that the staff do not care if they are clean and they certainly have no issue with customers doing there job for them by cleaning the tables. Staff are also very slow to clean empty glasses and bottles even when it is not busy at all. Customer service is also severely lacking. On multiple occasions we waited at the bar to be served while staff chatted to each other. Customer service is definitely not a priority. Also they have offers on drinks, but once again they failed to action the offer. Over charging us and when challenge before paying the response was there, there is nothing we can do about it as it being. Processed. So not only are the tables dirty, customer service is lacking they are also over charging clients, so always double check your bill. Other than those issues, could be a great club but they need new management"

Nestled alongside a picturesque riverside patio, this gem of a bistro offers an exquisite selection of seafood and wood-fired pizza that will leave your taste buds dancing with delight. The standout for me was the delectable Thai Chicken Pizza. The harmonious blend of zesty Thai flavors with succulent chicken and perfectly baked crust was nothing short of a taste revelation. It's a bold fusion that pays off in spades-a must-try for any pizza enthusiast. Equally impressive were the Curly Fries. Golden and crispy on the outside, with just the right amount of seasoning, they were a delightful accompaniment to our meal. These fries elevated the experience, adding an extra layer of satisfaction."

The burgers, which were once a hallmark of consistency, now lack the flavorful profile that patrons came to expect. The degradation in taste suggests a departure from the quality standards that contributed to McDonald reputation. Freshness, a key element in fast food, is an area that requires significant improvement. The ingredients do n't seem as vibrant or as crisp as they used to be, impacting the overall dining experience. The lack of freshness detracts from the essence of a fast-food meal, and it's a deviation from the standards that customers have grown accustomed to over the years. Moreover, the current taste of the burgers no longer justifies the price point. Previously, McDonald was synonymous with affordability and taste, but the recent changes in flavor do n't align with the cost. The value proposition seems to have shifted, leaving customers feeling that the quality no longer justifies the expenditure. In summary, the McDonald under review has faced a decline in the quality of its burgers, marked by a loss in taste and freshness. These aspects, coupled with a perceived mismatch between taste and price, indicate a departure from the standards that once made this establishment a go-to for fast-food enthusiasts. It may be crucial for the management to address these issues to restore the trust and satisfaction of their customer base."

People only wanting to live in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane and government's refusing to invest money outside those areas into new infrastructure.
I bet if the government bought in a policy that you pay more income tax if you live in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and you pay a lower rate if you live outside those areas, people might choose to move away.
All this talk of government paying to build houses is not a solution.  That is not the role of government."

I was genuinely shocked by how bad all the privatisation has been for your state. Here in WA it's much less privatised - for example, we can just go to the department of transport and get a new licence. An annual fee applies to the licence. 
In VIC I was shocked when I had to pay some unnecessary third party a fee to book an appointment on some dodgy web site that could've been slapped together by a high school student for a project. 
Vote against privatisation wherever you can. Resist it. It's never good."

The food is a mix of Indian classics and street food, with flavors that are usually spot-on, though some dishes may lack consistency. Portions are ample, and the restaurant is clean and family-friendly. While there's room for improvement in menu variety and service speed, Bollywood Treats is recommended for a fun, casual dining experience."

Bonfires at that time of year go back way before Guy Fawkes was born. At the time they were banning anything that wasn't a Christian practice. So something that had pagan roots was a big no no. I believe people claimed that they were celebrating the plot being discovered as an excuse to carry on having bonfire parties. As in no officer we are good Christians who just love our king we are definitely not pagans or anything like that (as they toss a ritual sacrifice on the fire).

Renewable industry? Green steel. Steel is massively energy intensive to produce. Build absolutely massive solar farms, use the raw materials here to build Green steel, export it.
Heck, if the government hasn't fucked everyone decades ago by selling off energy generation to the private industry, we could tempt manufacturing here by offering hugely discounted power pricing.
Never happened because of party politics. Decades of liberal scare campaign, ads showing the poor miners losing their jobs.
Basically, the tech exists to make the switch, thermal storage works great for overnight power. But the rich and powerful have easy access to politicians, so much so that the opposition leader took a flight across the country to spend 3 hours at a party with the human parasite known as Gina.
So we never got any traction in making these changes.
I was saying 15 years ago that if we don't start moving away from coal at a reasonable rate now, we will be forced to do it later at a much more painful rate. I was not alone in this. Instead, voters decided to keep voting in the guys who were beholden to those making money off coal. So, here we are. Reap what you sew I guess? 
That or we just double down and hasten the planet becoming unable to sustain human life. Actually with how fucking dumb we are as a species, maybe that's not such a bad idea."

The seats were not comfy at all. You ca n't lean back. The good thing is that it clean, so props for that. But check your popcorn I can still taste the salt.

It's called a rolling cloud. It is cause by fast windspeeds at higher altitude impacting the slower moving cloud layer. Think of it like the sand at the bottom of a stream with fast running water. the same pattern appears in the sand.  Also... it's brushwood screen fencing apparently lol
pretty common here... we get some ffreaky high windspeeds at higher altitudes. Much higher than typcial elsewhere. Making Melbourne my base in flightsim with real weather has bee nan  eye opener"

The main problem I have with this place is the card system. It is one of those card insert systems but sometimes it does n't register your card for at least 3-4 times. One time I tried 7 times. This is SO frustrating when you get into the elevator and while you are trying to use the card someone on one of the top floors calls the elevator and then you are stuck in it riding it, going all the way to the top, then picking up any others that have called the elevator on the way down. What should be a 20 second trip to level 3 ends up being a 3 min scenic tour of the entire building."

Provincial union has historically never been that big in Australia and there was usually only 2 teams (NSW / QLD).  The Brumbies did well but there was never the depth for the Rebels. It was a bad idea and to be honest Rugby Australia's scant resources are better focused on those 3 teams and the Force for as long as they have a fairy godfather in Twiggy.
I'd love to see Union be better run here but NRL is our professional rugby code.  It's crazy to me that the ""big money leagues"" for Union are France and Japan."

As for the customer service  it seems that basic manners and customer service skills do n't exist anymore. No acknowledgement from staff, not even a simple smile at any point and no eye contact when giving you your order. It Macca after all but it would be nice for staff to work on their RBF and treat customers like the ' valued customer ' name printed on the order ticket. You have to change the name of Happy Meals if staff keep up this attitude."

But I'll get to that at the end. Sunset Burger: Absolutely lovely, and tasty. Around on its own I believe, and then instead of going for the sides we opted for the loaded fries as another dish instead. The burger as a stand alone item would be. Loaded fries: Do n't get fooled by advertisement. It was 8, and I tasted 5 too much. Firstly the loaded element, which was hard to find any chicken it claimed to have in, I think I counted around 3 strands. And then alot of the loaded, is very central, so you feel there is no flavour else where. The main issue is the flavour / taste, the only way to describe it, is it tasted like the old mini oven pizzas I used to have when I was younger. The taste was identical to that pizza, which was so odd to have that cheap oven pizza taste on chips. It did n't have any unique flavours, or any spice. We had to drown it in hot sauce, to then get Hot Oven Pizza flavour. Honestly I would n't recommend it at all, it's not worth disappointing yourself for 8. Stick to what you know, and get the usual with 2 normal sides. And stay away from the odd flavours loaded fries. Shame!"

I think given enough time you eventually live next to dickheads. I think the best method to deal with them is to start a fight between them and another dickhead in the street, so that they take it out on each other.
I had an idea on how to do that. What you do is wait until their bin is emptied, and then fill it up with trash (the stinkier the better). Then you add some identifying piece of information, like a magazine subscription header or a letter, that points to the other dickhead neighbour. Then those two battle it out"

Also they cutoff their custom cocktails 40-50 minutes and sometimes an hour before they close at 1 am, so basically when they choose, because of some rule they could n't explain thoroughly to me. It's weird cause they still offer hard liquor drinks at 11AUD per pour. Does n't make sense. The vibe here is decent. I'd say this spot is best for a day party. They have different DJs and an accepting, open vibe where everyone is accepted no matter race, religion, or orientation. Everyone just wants to listen to good music or makeout haha Note: They wo n't let people in 30min before close and the bar is petty much open air with a rooftop so it's subject to the weather."

Labourers skill is marvelous, such an devotion to their work in making a monument that even after suffering many wear and tear of unpredictable harsh climate is standing intact. It is a fine example that history shall remember for many eras. Even inside the complex there is an mosque where hundreds of local residents throng to offer prayers five times a day.

I'm 40 and have never had a full time job. ( Well technically I have but it was month to month contracts and anyone who took a day off for any reason didn't have their contacts renewed.) 
I've been in my current job for 8 years and got denied permanency based on the fact that my shifts are irregular, and the annoying thing is the union rep agreed. Like I worked 2583 hours last financial year but because it wasn't 8 hrs a day 6 days a week, every week I don't get permanent.
Also as someone whose been casual for a while, other things have changed, like how long before a shift begins that they are scheduling something , places are literally getting calls from clients and saying yeah we can do that today for you, then ringing around staff to see whose available. It's shifting the risk/cost of business from the employer to the employee.
The law hasn't caught up with technology, I've talked to people who did my job more than 30 years ago, casual wasn't a thing because most people didn't have mobile phones, so they paid people to be on call, they don't anymore because everyone has a mobile so if I don't answer they'll try someone else and eventually someone will pickup and agree to come in. I've brought that up with the union and again they don't care.
 I want at a minimum what a friend in the US told me that they were proposing in his state ( can't remember if it went through) they were proposing a minimum notice period for temps ( what they call casuals) of 72hrs. A shift had to be scheduled with a person assigned to it at least 72 hours in advance. The only exception was if  someone called in sick. The Idea was to make businesses go back to putting people on call."

We had 0 migration in'20 and'21. The extra was just to offset our loss in migration.
The housing shortage has existed for over 10 years outside of the cities. 0.x% rental vacancy rates as well.
This problem was started by John Howard in the 90s and balloned during the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison era.
That's why Labor ran on housing reform in 2013, 2016 and 2019. Yet, Australians did not believe the housing crisis existed until it hit the cities. So now we're in a fucked position. Covid LNP money printing added to the problem, too, in the way of increasing interest rates.
I know it's both easy and lazy to blame migrants, and that is what Australians love. But it's far better to be accurate and to live in truth."

While we all know it not healthy eating, it was prepared well and the grey shirts in Mac Donald work very hard and I appreciate their service! But When I order something and get the wrong thing it annoys me. When I question my order to the white shirt taking my order and he tells me He has done it right even though I insisted I was being charged too much. This annoys me. When I walk 15 minutes to my office before sitting to eat, open it to find the wrong stuff it annoys me off. I already had to stand waiting for several minutes in a quiet restaurant( it definitely was n't busy), before asking to be served and that annoyed me Overall unimpressed by the man in the white shirt. And annoyed. Again thank you to the grey shirts for the continued hard work. White shirt manager person you owe me money and believe me when I say I will be in to let you know my feelings"

During my visit, the croissant with lemon filling was impressed with its flaky texture and delightful citrus flavour. However, a few unexpected lemon rind chunks slightly detracted from the experience. Despite this, Lune Cafe cozy ambience and friendly staff create a welcoming atmosphere perfect for indulging in their delicious pastries. Overall, Lune Cafe offers a delightful culinary experience, albeit with a minor flaw and a slightly higher cost."

Listen to what they got away at the last election, they ""won the argument"" by convincing the gullible public that all you had to do was vote for one party over another in order to have more cheap green energy, at no cost to anyone (that includes taxpayers and consumers) and they did this without providing any real policy detail or proper costings. If anyone dared to question this false argument, they were labelled either a ""denier"" of climate change or were subject to ridicule for not understanding the benefits of renewable energy. 
These arguments are extremely clever, at the end of the day, the ALP is a ruthless political machine, and Bowen and co and experienced and professional politicians. They skillfully framed the ""climate change"" debate as a political argument, and they won that argument comprehensively. Yet here we are, 2 years down the track and facing the prospect of blackouts, you can't make this stuff up."

2 doesn't dump you on to to a regular road at the city end 
3 goes more places! West gate/tulla freeways/ City through to lakes entrance! 
4 only so busy because it's so useful! 
5 (a stretch here) my experience is that the connecting roads are worse on the eastern at peak times . Alex parade is a car park, hoddle st is hoddle st, chandler highway to kew jnc is a nightmare, chandler north used to be the biggest bottleneck in the state (now fixed) Tran rd Doncaster road, bulleen rd all problematic! 
6 will be just as busy as the Monash when the north east link opens! 
PS in reality I do have many complaints about the Monash, mostly the people on it!"

Remember that this whole issue allegedly stems from a directive that Giles passed almost a year ago, which required tribunals to take into consideration how long a person had spent in Australia when revoking or restoring their visas etc.
One person has died - which is clearly very horrible - But the killer's visa had expired in 2019. Why was he still in the country? And why wasn't the minister informed that this person's visa had been restored? How long has that been the normal practice within the department? 
Ultimately, we need a lot more information; the department could prove Giles wrong very easily with a few emails. But as it's a Labor government, the press will continue to blow the issue out of proportion and take up the opposition's line of attack as if it's genuine"

We ordered smashed, they were n't super smashed but good. Chilly fries were yummy, but bacon cheese ones tastes like burnt onion, not like bacon bits on it. Cheese sauce was really good. A little bit expensive, but nice place and convenient location. Recommended, probably will come back."

Naan has got smaller and middle of the naan is like paper with burns. This business is not operating in an ethical way since they have two lines for naan. One line of one pack and another line for more than one pack. Which is ridiculous cos line for more than one pack gets stagnant while one pack line moves since they serve only that line. They need to adopt a number serving system soon I think. Lot of fighting happening there during weekends. Hope the owners think about a better way soon before the council or police intervenes for a pack of naan

How many here have dreams and goals, whether its a dream career you've tried to chase or a goal that seems pretty damn evasive... How many of you peeps worked insanely hard to try and achieve it and fell flat?
If you have, how do you get over the feeling of failure without failing? Like, the whole ""what's the point"" kind of thing. I am having some struggles, although its not at that point yet, but its just feeling like i'm not going to achieve my goals any time soon and its been negatively affecting my mind a bit."

They have a kids menu and gave us a corner spot for the toddler on a high chair when we made a note on the reservation. The restaurant is quite big and is a good spot to have a family meal. I enjoyed the service and the variety of food options. Would recommend the pasta and the kangaroo meat was cooked nicely. Was an amazing enjoyable evening and appreciated the service. Would come back to try out the pizza next time and the seafood risotto.

The coffee ,0,"Comfy and relaxing coffee shop right in the centre of Woolwich in general Gordon Square. The coffee is delicious, with a nice selection of other drinks, pastries, treats, sandwiches. One of the reasons I continue returning here is the accessible location and super comfortable leather seating, and huge windows where you can people watch to your hearts content. The staff in here are friendly and I am always greeted with a smile. The vibe is chilled with green walls on the interior, wooden tables, framed images and a section on the wall with clocks set to main cities around the world. The place is kept very clean, so you wo n't see tables with used coffee cups lying around. There is also an outside seating area where the train station, DLR, bus stops and taxi rank are all in sight along with the main square which is surrounded by all kinds of shops including a big Tesco Extra, bars, hair salons, ice cream shops etc. Definitely worth a visit. # woolwich # coffee # visitwoolwich # southeastlondon"

But this week was a disaster. I waited 20 mins for a coffee inside. Everyone got theor stuff & I could n't get anyone attention. When the girl finally asked a you still waiting for your latte a single one latte I said are sure I am she disappeared and then came back within a second with the cold coffee and said sorry the machine was n't working. I'm not sure I'm going to make this my go-to place anymore because this is not the first time this is about the third time in as many weeks this has happened so clearly a big turn around which is a real pity. Staff need to know that service is n't a smile service is actually doing something and providing service being paid for.

Staff were friendly and quick to serve a good job as the parking outside is limited to 30 minutes. Multi storey car park close by but as we have a van the height restriction meant we could n't access this. If like me you love Wetherspoons this is a nice one to tick off your list.

I had tried their newly launched soya wrap which was average in taste but the 7 Up drink enhanced the overall experience. The salads were good. I got their paneer tikka and veggie patty salads mixed which tasted great. Their Oatmeal cookie and the double-chocolate cookie( much better) was good in taste. Choco truffle cake was a great addition to the overall meals.

Once you step inside, the service is friendly and attentive and nothing seems to be a problem. I feel kind of mean, only giving them 4 stars, but there was just something that was n't quite "" right "". Apart from the overwhelming clutter that passes for decor, we really enjoyed our meal, choosing 3 items from the smaller tapas menu and a salad, instead of having a main. The Chili mussels were kind of small and did n't quite make it to "" perfect "" level despite a tasty and nicely hot sauce. The arancini balls were smushy inside, instead of distinctly "" risotto-like "". The garlic prawns were to die for... tender, plump, huge and tasty. But the thing that really intrigued me was the salad, which was "" bean, heads of broccoli and peas "". A quick read of the menu seemed to indicate that these three are the only green vegetables the chef knows how to prepare. They appeared on the other menu options. As my hubby says..., broccoli and peas must have been cheap this. There was nothing wrong exactly. All the food was tasty and well-presented. There was just something undefinable missing. But do n't get me wrong... The Toscana is busy and popular and it did n't disappoint. It's definitely worth a visit."

Gonna skip the usual Morrison circlejerk (oh Scott Morrison exercised political savvy to do no actual work? Shocker /s) and just highlight this point - the LNP will whinge Labor does nothing, but when Labor actually hires real staff to do work (more on ""real"" in a sec) now it is ""hiring for the wrong sectors/wasting money on'too good' public servants"" and other bullshit.
I say ""real"", because the alternative is pure contractors, which often cost more than regular staff (since the worker and the company has to make a profit or else cut corners to make money) and yet are seen as ""good"" because hey you create private sector jobs (which are magically worth more than public sector jobs because ???).
Anyway, nice to see Dutton falling back to classics /s."

The staff were friendly and cheerful... just what you need to start the day. There were few people in when we were but our wait for meals was long... 25mins ? THe tea came in a plunger set up but the plunger had been put down so the tea was weak as tap water. The poached eggs were badly over cooked. The "" toast "" was bread basically. The hash brown was miniscule and was cold. I mean we were not going to die but come on.... basic stuff I would think. We probably will return as I said we need places in Nerang.

In the UK Civil Registration wasn't compulsory until 1837. So for me I'm always happy finding ancestors that were born before 1800, as they didn't have to keep any record. So my wife's family are old blood Londoners and I found out that one of them lived 2 doors down from where Jack the Ripper killed his 2nd victim. So finding things like that trumps some crusty lords life."

Is there a group chat I don't know about? You don't need to talk about me in the abstract. Allan was talking to her own education (in the 70s and 80s) and d'Arbrera pretends Allan was talking to the current curriculum (40-50 years later). The premise of the article is one-dimensional (as well as false)  so of course my response was going to be in those terms. It doesn't merit a deeper response.

Direct democracy can't fail to achieve the good of the majority, although nothing is perfect and it can behave woefully for the minority if it is not accompanied by learning reason. I was going to include compassion, however a reasoning person would be aware that showing compassion to others also includes when one is on the receiving end: it's part of the wisdom in ""do unto others as you would have others do unto you"".
However, direct democracy would have to be better than representative democracy in that there are more people involved where selfishness and other vices tend to better cancel themselves out. Nothing is perfect, but better is more useful than worse or the same.
Therefore, I encourage the people of Australia to urge government in the direction of direct democracy, to start by creating an uncensored anonymous online forum for reasoned debate and feeding public sentiment back to government who is supposed to be representing that sentiment; along with an associated education program for the experts advising government to also present their expertise to the people of Australia who are already paying for it; basic facilities for every Australian adult to contribute to the forum; and reduced working hours to allow them to participate.
Freedom of speech, not freedom of action, needs to be restored to the Australian people instead of chilling discussion by punishing speech arbitrarily interpreted as hateful or resulting in hurt feelings. Speech has no meaning in itself, only in its interpretation and particularly subsequent action, which is why it needs to be free. Even the interpretation of speech is on the receiver, not the speaker: the speaker has no control over how the receiver interprets or respods to their speech, especially when the words can have multiple interpretations even if both parties have the same understanding of speech.
As for being hateful or hurtful to feelings, feelings are subjectively created and autonomously acted out, within each individual person, outside of the control of a speaker. Whilst a speaker's intent may be to trigger emotions in a recipient and acting them out in a certain way to achieve a particular agenda, those emotions are created by the recipient, for good or ill, as part of the normal function of a human being and are not the responsibility of any external party. We are not our brothers keeper.
It is therefore vital that we teach people to manage their own emotions, with reason, so that they don't take action that becomes the source of objective harm. Speech is not action or cause of action: that is always performed by the recipient depending on how they interpret and action that speech, internally as well as externally."

The menu is a little reduced at the moment due to what they said was a nationwide issue with hiring staff. That being said, the food that was still on the menu is up to its usual standard. There a limited choice of desserts if you have a milk allergy-but they managed to cobble something together that was quite nice for me. I recommend the firecracker chicken if you looking for something spicy."

I can't prove,1,"It's going to take about 6 months for McBride's new lawyers to put together an appeal. I can't prove his innocence in a reddit post. I just want to draw attention to the case, especially the blatant corruption of this judge and what that represents.
Politicians may not really care about their donors paying less taxes, but their bosses do. I hope judges are mostly honest as they have usually decided to make less money than they would as lawyers. However, this one has shown too many signs of corruption. The people who appoint and promote judges are corrupt and McBride had secrets they wouldn't let the public know.
Also, the judge hid that sentencing was going to take place until a last minute change of plans. I believe that being more senior, more visible and less incentivised to appease politicians should mean judges of the high court are trustworthy (certainly a hundred times more trustworthy than Mossop). I believe they will overturn the  verdict or at least give McBride a lighter sentence. Unfortunately legislators are highly against whistle blowing..
I'd also trust a more junior judge. Mossop seems to have been promoted above his level of competency, which seems suspicious."

I told him while ",0,"This was me!  My boyfriend bought me a necklace that I knew I would never wear.  
I told him while I liked the necklace (white lie), I knew I'd never wear it because if I was going to wear this particular type of necklace, I'd wear the one I already owned as it held great sentimental value.  
I said I'd love it if he could return it and get a simple (far cheaper) necklace that I didn't have in my collection, but that I would cherish as more likely to wear it. 
Given the emotional connection he knew I had to the sentimental necklace, he was very gracious and was happy to exchange it.  
I didn't end up with my simple necklace, it was about 10x more expensive because he felt so bad (my tears helped lol). But i do love it.
Humility and graciousness, while being honest, goes a long way."

The staff really friendly and helpful. we had pasta and steak this time after a starter of pate and mixed cold meats. Loved it. A lovely Restaurant, the music the staff and the ambiance was lovely. We had pizza which was nice but the crust was bland, it did n't have that Italian pizza crust flavour, we got fries and they were under cooked and hard in the middle so we left them and told the staff but still got charged for them. We got the meat and cheese selection, which was lovely but we got bread sticks with it and again these just did n't have any flavour."

Robodebt was already unjustifiable under our current legal system, or even under the most basic level of scrutiny. 
This is why the state is now up for huge sums in compensation for the wholly foreseeable harms it caused. 
The problem we face is that ministers are willing to breach the laws for short term electoral gains. Being able to claim a balanced budget when they know full well that it was going to swing back and hit us in the chin after the next election cycle, but they did it anyway because that was future Australia's problem. 
Doubling down on extrajudicial sentencing after the high court has already ruled it out, shows that the bastardry is bipartisan. 
If robodebt and asylum seeker policy is anything to go by, the electorate is completely unwilling to hold these bastards accountable, because we collectively have the memory of a goldfish in low oxygen water.  
It's not just a matter of time before it happens again, as the same income averaging is being used today - they are currently using it to claim vexatious debts from my mother who died 2 and a half years ago."

Bryon bay lager had a clean crisp taste, so pretty good. The honey chicken starter was excellent. Rissoles were just ok, not much flavour. The steak sandwich and burgers were pretty good. The calamari was pretty good. The stuffed chicken was just ok, not very stuffed and not much flavour. The Chips and side gravy sauces were good. The flat white coffee was pretty good. The sticky date pudding was light weight, the sauce was fine but just ordinary pudding overall. Typical club / pub atmosphere. Friendly service, plenty of parking. Overall we had a pretty good time."

Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.
So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.
The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).
This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.
Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 
It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.
Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 
There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.
So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too."

It's natural though as they're two of the biggest cities in the country with a similar population. 
NSW vs QLD State of Origin is probably the closest answer and most reasonable. Most people I know that don't bother watching regular NRL games almost always tune into State of Origin anyways. (Speaking as someone from Sydney) there's a wholly agreed upon sentiment to hate the other state out of loyalty of their own.  The rivalry isn't as heated as something you'd find in a European football league but it's close as you'll get in Australia."

You have created a good place and I hope that your service brings a change in your place and gives a fresh and good vibe to the customers."

Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid theworsening police pay crisis.
In what is threatening to become the biggest schism between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in abitter stalemate with the Police Associationover a push to introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.
Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn't incur additional costs or require extra resources.
""I don't think you'll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,"" Mr Carbines said.
""That process continues and while that process is under way, it's not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.""
But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association announced a ""breakthrough"".
Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O'Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month's state budget.
Mr O'Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee's work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force's annual wages bill.
He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety  a claim vehemently denied by the police union.
""The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,"" Mr Carbines said.
""The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined."" Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. ""When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can't explain his mistakes,"" he said. ""Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent."""

Then the nuggets were put in with the chicken. Had to remove the chicken to get to the nuggets for grandies as the wanted them straight away. Also Ordered 5 tenders for immediate snack. Get to car. Not there so back in and told they were also in with chicken and guess what... no they were n't. Not a fan of Kfc at best but this has done me for good.

The traditional pattern has been to take rest days from one fortnight and put them with the usual four rest days in the next fortnight to have six consecutive days off after working 7 night shifts followed by two AM or PM shifts but those days aren't'extra leave'. Since 2011 there has been a recovery day after night shift so that people finishing a 7am on a Sunday aren't required to come back to work at 3pm the same day but that's hardly'extra leave' either.

I pointed this out and we were given another table which was marginally better. As we were there you could clearly see staff cleaning the tables after customers left but everything being wiped off was going on the seats and floor and just left there! That's not how you prepare for the next customers. It is n't even half a job. Filthy really! Food thankfully was good. I had a chickpea burger but the rice was barely warm. Overall cleanliness needs working on big time!

The pet",1,"Last day to sign Aus petition for consumer rights of digital software (Stop Killing Games).
The petition is located here. This whole thing is mostly being run by Ross Scott of Accursed Farms.
Figured it would be good to post this final reminder to Aussies before it gets closed. If you have experienced having your favourite game servers shut down (even for single player games that companies decide to disable access to for no good reason), it's worth taking a moment to sign this. This applies to more than just games and includes other digital software as well.
Thank you."

If I am taking a certain train route to work everyday, and I am regularly passing by homeless people who aren't in their right mind, I'm going to engage with them as little as possible. I can't risk having one of them becoming fixated, or getting aggressive.
I will donate to charities to help, i will go with a group of people to help them, but as a young woman I'm just never going to approach them on my own, not when I work nights and get home late.
If this makes me a coldhearted bitch, then whatever. I come from trauma myself, I know what it can do to people. And I know that they're victims too. But we all need to put ourselves first. And my safety is my number one priority."

The food exceeded expectations and was very tasty, especially the squid salad starter and the duck main. We also ordered a pizza which was also very nice. My only criticism would be that the portion sizes were a little on the small side, but was somewhat made up for by tasting great. Another side note is that the tables were a touch on the small side for a party of 4 and we kept bumping elbows."

The UB billtong was a highlight-soft and tasty. Only reason I rated at a 4 not a 5 was the service. The staff member looking after us was n't particularly interested in us unlike some of the other tables with more people on them. I would have liked to hear more about the wine pairings and the food as part of the experience. However it was a busy night for them so I understand.

Arriving at AM on a Sund,0,"The Press Shop was our first stop for brunch during our day trip to Bowral. Arriving at AM on a Sunday, we were surprised to find a line, but our friends quickly secured a table for our group. A server promptly approached us to take our drink orders while we reviewed the menu. After a few minutes, we chose our dishes and flagged down the same waiter. Despite ordering our food soon after our drinks, there was a noticeable delay, and we nearly finished our drinks before the food arrived. However, the dishes were well-presented and generously portioned. The restaurant seemed understaffed, as it took about five minutes to pay our bill, requiring us to call the attention of the same waiter who had served us. Overall, still a delightful experience."

Initially pre booked over a week prior, was on time but rushed through ordering without barely reading the menu. Pressure and stress the entire time. Asked if food was ok before we even took bite & constantly interrupted. If there was a time limit no one communicated this with us. Really made the whole night a very uncomfortable, rushed and stressful experienced. No ordering extra drinks or dessert. Food was excellent as always. Experience and Service horrible. After supporting this business since it opened I do n't feel like dining in anymore. I paid over 150 just to be rushed out the door and night completely ruined. ACCESS Is not all abilities accessible, difficult access with low steps into the building, very crowded with furniture inside making it difficult to navigate with mobility equipment. NUERODIVERSE Noisy and aggressive service not friendly to those with diverse needs."

electricity isn't real. It can't work like how the scientists say it does in real life, it needs extra intervention and direction from ""someone or something"". Otherwise the electricity wouldn't flow in the neat circuits it does and would get lost. There's ""elec-trickery"" afoot.
Maybe there's actually a shady world government spy agency who's in charge of all electricity flows. Maybe it has a will of its own. Maybe there's some omnipotent figure guiding all electricity. Either way, there's something ""they"" aren't telling us and all is not what it seems.
It's not a real conspiracy but it's stuck with me and makes me laugh every time I think about it."

Although the name eludes my memory, the overall experience left a lasting impression. The cafe proved to be a budget-friendly haven, offering a range of options without denting the wallet. We opted for a burger meal and a hot wings meal, enticed by the promise of satisfying our hunger without breaking the bank. The portions were generous, a welcome sight for voracious appetites. The burger meal and hot wings meal arrived promptly, exuding tempting aromas that hinted at the flavors awaiting exploration. The affordability-to-portion ratio set the stage for what promised to be a fulfilling dining experience. The first bites revealed a commendable effort in crafting enjoyable fare. While the flavors were commendable, the lack of a satisfying crunch was a notable point of consideration. Despite the minor crispiness setback, the food resonated well with my hunger-stricken state. The savory notes and ample portions compensated for the nuanced aspect, ensuring an enjoyable meal. It's a testament to the cafe ability to deliver on the fundamental promise of satiating hunger at an affordable price. Regrettably, the cafe name escapes my recollection, hindering the ability to give due credit to this hidden gem in Wakefield City Center. The overall enjoyment of the food and the satisfaction of a well-fed appetite make this establishment a contender for future visits. A hidden gem indeed, awaiting a more memorable encore. # WakefieldCafeExperience # AffordableEats"

I know theres plenty of pressure from the development lobby and others to not do any of this, but at what point does your desire for political survival trump pleasing your corporate overlords? If there's a rate rise they will fall into Minority next election, and if it's more then one potentially losing.

People do it to ""cheap and cheerful"" whites/rose a lot, it is considered a bit low-brow but is fairly common at low-brow establishments. Reds almost never, but occasionally an old lady wants iced red.
When I worked a wine bar it was a lot less common, but it happened. Usually people would stick to whatever our cheapest white by the glass was if they were gonna do that. But I was asked once to put ice in a Domaine Sainte Marie rose, and another time in a De Sainte-Gall champagne. I don't think I can ever go to France now. They'll look at me and just *know*. I'm afraid of random mobs forming to seek justice for what I have done.  
In 20 years of selling drinks I have never been asked to put ice in beer. Ever. That is insane talk. Nobody would do that. What the actual fuck."

Anywhere that moves ,0,"The markets are usually the best bet (Queen Vic/Dandenong/South Melbourne ect). Anywhere that moves a good volune will be getting it in fresh. Buy stuff from Australia (only exception I make is Golden Pomfret from Malaysia) and its likely to be good and fresh.
I found the shopping centre ones to be more expensive and awful, for this reason.
The seafood market is at the ports near Kensington. All the wholesalers/fishers/importers set up there. The markets and retail sellers go there to buy it (its not open to the public before you start asking).
From there it goes to markets/shops for the public to buy.
The other good option is Costco. They move a huge volume so its usually fresh and reasonably priced. Buy in bulk, portion it and freeze it. Cook in the oven."

The landlords and the real estate agent came over yesterday to have a look and yes, it is a mess up there, full of rat and possum shit and piss. The joy.
They are getting a pest man and a possum man to clean up and treat the area over the next week. Thankful for such a quick response from them. They seem to be taking it seriously and it's not an uncommon thing i.e they have dealt with it before.
They are also taking liberties to board up / put mesh on the roof where the possums and the rodents might be getting in."

I myself had the roast pork which came with seasonal vegetables, roast potatoes, stuffing and a Yorkshire. Overall the flavour and portion size was good, the Yorkshire was a bit too well done for my liking( it was basically air and was crumbly). The roast potatoes were gorgeous! Likely to return again my only niggle is I wish the service had been a little more attentive post ordering food. We had to wait quite a bit of time for our plates to be cleared after finishing and we not offered any additional drinks until the end of our meal. Pricing is n't bad for the what you get however a service charge was added to the bill which we reluctantly paid just so we could get out quicker having waited some time for the bill. Not a bad spot for lunch, friendly atmosphere; love that it dog friendly:"

It's why the west is failing and Asia is growing at a rapid rate. It's much harder to start a business, or get a job in a new industry in the west now. We have all forgotten that people want to make money and we need less barriers, not more, to make that happen.
Woke policies, nanny state policies, lots of environmental bull shit, nimby, over regulated.   And each year it's just getting worse and worse because the more laws the government introduces the harder it gets for business to swim through the swamp of shit law."

It's a stupid position, for anyone that's read the genocide convention, cause how is any state meant to work to prevent and punish a crime, if they can't assess if its happening, when its happening? Its a really gutless position. We probably shouldn't be signed up to genocide convention, if we don't follow its obligations when needed.
A big arse study on the matter just dropped today, that he could consult, if our parliamentarians wanted to do more than feign ignorance. Yet it seems Orwellian nonsense and ignorance is Labor's best friend at the moment.
I find the'river to the sea=s no two state solution' the most bs part of his comments though. Such a weird direction for gov to frame things. People not wanting to live in apartheid like conditions says nothing about whether there's one or two states. Calling for freedom is vague enough that people can mean allsorts by it, yet this gov chooses the'freedom =s antisemitism \[destruction of Israel\]', in rhetoric taken straight from Tel Aviv.
And based on this Orwellian revisionism by Labor, shouldn't they be condemning Payman, not saying she showed guts? They can't even follow their own bs properly."

The overall service is very good and the staff of the hotel is also very friendly. The rooms are quiet and well furnished but the sofas in all the rooms were pretty dated and used. The fitness room is pretty standard and the pool sauna is also nice to have. Would recommend but is overall a mid ranged costing option in Reading center.

Arresting people struggling with mental health or addiction is a temporary fix, as is chucking them in hospital where beds are severely limited. 
There's sort of a weird grey space now where it's like, sure  people have rights and those places were often inhumane, but what's the solution to keep them and others safe? We need a hell of a lot more funding and thinking outside the box research towards what to do in regards to this issue. It seems to be small band aid fixes like ""hey, let's restrict opiate pain meds for everyone, that'll solve some shit"" without looking at a lot of core issues. So many factors. Health care. Income. Stress. Housing factors. Familial issues. Education. It's so multifaceted."

The upper side of this cafe is hard to climb and get down. I do n't know about the cameras but I saw a few young people making cozy and romance on the upper side of their cafe. Not recommended for families. They need to improve their walk-ins.

We transferred all of them to me on my license to protect them, as the cops treat them poorly, damage expensive scopes etc. Cost $10k in lawyer fees to get it overturned and the avo lifted once the actually looked at the evidence. 
Having said that, in DV, suspected DV situations it makes sense that it would trigger an automatic response like a license suspension. That should go alongside a simple system of their storage and return, that is not a financial burned on the parties involved."

Borders are a scar, first of all. Illiberal and shit ideas. (Nations can have border laws or surveillance laws, the double dipping is bullshit)

Either we believe in rehabilitation, or we don't."

At I phoned again asking where our order was. I was told they had a delivery issue with their delivery crew and that the pizzas would be delivered within the next 35 minutes. What a joke. We finally got our delivery at which was nearly cold when we opened the boxes. I agree with previous reviews by people that they are cooked when you order them and then they sit somewhere until they are delivered. I would not be recommending Domino delivery service to anyone and certainly wo n't be using them again for entertaining visitors or friends. Shame really as I have never had this problem in the past but have had problems with orders taken and when they are delivered not what I ordered.

I ordered a double grill beef burger and loaded fries individually, and the total came up to over 15. I thought this should be good and tasty based on the reviews. I requested the fries to be cooked crispy, as, let's be honest, most fast food establishments fail at this mere task. So my food arrives, and on first impressions, chips were soggy and not crispy as requested and tasted very salty. The burger again, nothing special size of patty to bun ration just did n't make sense. Taste was was ok nothing special. Now, this could be just a one-off scenario, as everyone has an off day, but I suggest based on the prices they deliver food worthy of it."

A ",1,">Does the AFR know its actually not illegal for private enterprise to consider and cost nuclear?
A proper feasibility study costs seven or eight figures, and that is difficult to justify when the biggest risk - or issue - is that the technology is illegal.
Corporates price risk in their economic models, and the premium required to justify investigating a technology that is currently not legal is just too high.
Plus most suppliers won't quote on equipment to be used in nuclear programs that are not explicitly sanctioned."

Service was quick & friendly, the juice was tasty, I personally would lived more Ginger but that's personal preference, same re my coffee, I love strong coffee & usually ask for extra shot, but it was pleasant, my friend said their latte was very good. The Eggs Benedict were both tasty and generous serves with the eggs cooked perfectly, my bacon came crispy as asked & a generous serving of salmon on the other. I like how the sourdough was t too thick. Overall I was very happy with the food and service, bringing family back so we can do the grazing plate. Also, live how a staff member brought out a bowl of water for a dog who was sitting patiently while his owner ate, Happy to recommend and visit again, as plenty on the menu to try."

The girls however are just terrible, there's no sense of urgency with them and they are happy to take 20 years serving someone a coffee waiting for the final drips so it seems, then they take payment, slowly. I've seen them ignore a queue of people, I could n't leave my colleagues if it was that busy myself. Also just a lack of friendly atmosphere with them, at least Rob smiles and says hello!

It has nice garlic flavour and very less spicy. I ordered chicken momos and drumsticks and both tasted very good and portion size is also huge. Got 10 momos and 8 drumsticks. That s a decent portion. I also ordered double egg garlic noodles. This is a bit upset for me. It was very oily but tasted good. Worth mentioning part is their chicken drumsticks does n't have any food color. Also, their staff service is very good. They suggested us their best try items and also service is courteous. Overall-go to place for Chinese dishes."

The huge area made it quite loud. I may have noticed it more as I was with a hearing impaired person. There are big umbrellas outside but it was very muggy on that day and not nice outside. My client had a Beef burger and chips( fries). He said it was very nice. His mango smoothie was nice but not as good as other places nearby. I had fried chicken. It was one piece of boneless chicken, resembling a schnitzel. I enjoyed it. The chips looked and tasted the same as MacDonald. They were hot and nice enough. I prefer a thick cut chip, but these were about as good as fries get. I also had american lemonade. I think they call it QE2 or something like that. It was delicious. My client wants to go back next time. I would like to try some other things on the menu."

This endless reshuffle of government departments all gone, the paper pushing bureaucrats retrained to do stuff like fix our roads. Large numbers of laws and regulations repealed.  Local government's pulled into line. 
It is really amazing how bad Queensland has got under Labor.   Highest taxing Qld state government in history and the infrastructure is just falling down.
Where the hell is the money going? The government is absolutely rolling in it, yet the debt is predicted to head to $188 billion, and that is the labor treasurer's prediction."

Some of the Greens ideas are good, like a commonwealth builder, but they also have some rank populist lines being trod out very often."

This woman has no place in Labour and I am flabbergasted she has such support after the nonsense she speaks. She gets mocked because she gets numbers wrong which is amazing because she says far far worse things.
If a white person said half the stuff she did they would be branded racist and hounded out by the left but she gets a free pass? Why?"

Today I ate in for the first time as I had a visiting relative. We headed up to the Mayflower street location at and were seated right away next to a window which was nice. Beautiful decor. We both had pancakes-one maple syrup bacon and the Special menu tiramisu pancakes. The pancakes were very dry and the maple syrup on the side for my relative a very small portion. We wondered if the pancakes were pre made as they did n't taste fresh. I asked for an extra pot of sauce with mine as it had dry ladyfingers biscuits crushed ontop and a whole one-I was expecting this to be soaked in coffee like it comes in tiramisu, but it was nt. I dunked this in my mocha coffee whick worked. The staff had no problem bringing me a little pot of extra sauce to help with dryness. For for 3 pancakes and toppings, I would have expected more succulent / moist food. It was beautifully presented. Noone asked us how the food was after it arrived, which was slightly telling that maybe people mention the pancakes are dry. My relative was n't able to finish hers due to the dryness. I also think the coffee sizes are a bit on the small side( even the large) but it tasted good. Maybe the more savoury options are better here than the sweet ones. We were also asked to tip 10 % when we ordered and paid."

Pulling faces and arguing over things that do n't matter. After reading a couple of the owners replies to other reviews I can see he is just a rude guy that refuses to accept any responsibility. Other staff member I met was nice but overshadowed by that guy. Possibly the worst customer service experience.

The coffee is also really really nice and love getting one with our meal and then one for takeaway on our way out! The only critique would be that ordering can be a bit slow with the lineup for such a big restaurant. Maybe QR codes or table service would do the trick, as you can easily wait in line to order for 20 minutes. Also, was almost charged the card surcharge when paying cash!;-"

I have been given larger complimentary servings elsewhere. Here's an idea, how about bottomless prawn crackers for that price-they cost nothing to make. The pad Thai came enveloped in a very thin omelette skin-not seen it done like that but was nice and portion size was good. I've had nasei goreng many times and this is the first time it's been served wet. Rice was soaked in sauce-I prefer it to be drier, also I think the portion size of this was on the small side. No complaints regarding the deep fried fish. Tasted lovely and crispy-went down well. Nice, attentive' and friendly staff. I'd probably rate the whole experience as"

Some doors operated this, others did n't. At times I was stopped, I was kept stood beside the doors that continued to open to allow people to exit to go to the lavatory, also get hit and injured by the doors as those feeling unwell were rushed out the side doors.

Starters of lamb chops and chicken tikka were average, but the onion bhajis were really good. Mains were where things got really good. The lamb lababdaar was fantastic with a very good chicken tikka dish and saag paneer. Rice and naan were nice but the portions were a little on the small side. Great meal overall, but the venue was let down by the fact the lighting was very bright and a little stark and whenever anyone opened the door, there was nothing to prevent a very cold draught."

From the moment you take ,0,"The culinary journey at this restaurant is nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment you take your first bite, you're enveloped in a symphony of flavors that captivate the senses. Let's start with the salted chicken  tender pieces of chicken marinated in a delicate blend of spices and salt, resulting in a dish that is both succulent and flavorful. Each bite reveals layers of complexity, with the seasoning perfectly complementing the natural sweetness of the chicken. Next up is the seafood rice, a dish that transports you to the shores of distant seas with its bounty of fresh seafood. Succulent shrimp, tender squid, and plump mussels mingle with fragrant rice, creating a harmonious fusion of land and sea. Every spoonful is a delight, with the flavors of the ocean dancing on your palate. And then there's the confit duck, a masterpiece of culinary craftsmanship. The duck is slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in meat that is meltingly tender and imbued with rich, savory flavors. The skin is rendered to a crispy perfection, providing the perfect contrast to the luscious meat beneath. But it's not just the individual dishes that shine; it's the meticulous attention to detail that elevates the dining experience to new heights. Each ingredient is carefully sourced and expertly prepared, ensuring that every dish is a masterpiece in its own right. With prices ranging from 9-10 per dish, this restaurant offers exceptional value without compromising on quality.

Of the two sausage rolls, one was completely dried out with a crunchy layer of meat on the bottom, the 2nd one was the opposite, it felt half cooked, the filling was wet and mushy. We also got a few small desserts to take to a friends, they were actually quite nice, especially the cheesecake tart. Lastly we got a sliced rye bread to take home, this also had issues. The whole loaf fell apart when trying to take a slice as the middle was still wet and gluggy. I do n't like slamming small business, but i also do n't like wasting money. Not sure what went wrong, but two thirds of what we bought was inedible."

The chairs are super uncomfortable-would definitely recommend trying to get one of the padded ones if you can, as the standard ones were awful. Lots of parking either on wood street or in the parking lot at end of road. Easy to get to. A little on the pricier side for some of their dishes but mostly pretty good. Would eat here again."

I can't find a good image right now but the easiest way to understand it is to look at a map of both countries with the rivers and mountain ranges.
Basically, our deserts are bigger. There's no farmland in the middle of the country. Very few rivers to divert. We have less water overall (even the coastal cities rely pretty heavily on desalination and recycling). We also don't have as many people.
 There have been proposals to pipe water into the middle of the country but they've been laughed out of town, it would be astronomically expensive and there isn't much demand for Alice Springs to become a major city."

The caf is good value for a quick, small lunch. Soup and Sandwiches seem to be the main lunch items on offer. Limited seating with it being situated on the mezzanine level, so best to either avoid at the height of lunch time or make sure you secure a table before ordering. At the busiest times, staff are caught up with serving and are distracted, so you may have to wait a short while at the counter to order and at the till to pay. Pleasant gift shop area with a range of goods suited to both children and adults."

If you were talking about violent crimes committed against immigrants, I could understand it. That's not what you're talking about here - and frankly you're a little insulting, assuming that you are for real.
Australia's level of immigration has been far too high for several years without any commensurate expansion in infrastructure. Everyone settles in Melbourne or Sydney. This has created a very noticeable decline in living standards in terms of overcrowding - not just traffic, but in schools, hospitals, etc. A lot of people don't want any more of this and it's hard to blame them. The housing situation is unimaginably horrible and it is getting worse. The amenity of living in Australia (for those of us who knew it in the mid 90s) is now gone. 
If I were you, I'd keep my mouth shut about centrelink, etc. We are living in a per capita recession as we speak and mass immigration is the only way that the government can gaslight the people that everything is cool because we don't have an actual negative GDP print(even though it feels like recession for the average punter). I grew up in the US and I've been getting stick from Aussies since God was a boy. So I moved back a few months ago after many years. You can do it too, sport, if you feel strongly about it."

The service was very efficient. The starters were fairly good. The funghi aranchini was spot on and so was the calamari fritto. The main course were a bit of a let down. The pizza( Fiorentina) tasted like something from a supermarket. The base was not well baked and the ingredients did n't seem fresh. The dessert( Panna cotta) seemed to follow the main course-tasted like a supermarket version. Overall a disappointment

The water park is a highlight for kids and with its open layout it's easy to keep an eye on the little ones both in the splash area or while playing on the playground equipment. There is plenty of seating available( however more could be shaded) and with the edition of the public barbecues it's a location where just about everyone will enjoy. The toilets are clean and well maintained and the skatepark / bike tracks offer something for the older kids to enjoy too. It's quite evident that the council has invested considerable time and money into this location.

I asked him what he's doing for work as he used to be self employed but went under during Covid lockdowns. 
Got a job on the Big Build coz he grew up in Melb back in the day and has CFMEU contacts. Zero qualifications or trade - he told me that. $140k a year. 
I asked him what he does and ""nothing, I do nothimg"" is the exact reply. When pressed for better details he said he technically supervises someone but he said because that person/people do nothing he considers himself to do nothing. 
Welcome to Victoria. And wait for the Union clowns to tell us how dangerous it is or defend this nonsense. 
I dunno why the teachers, cops, nurses, aged care workers etc etc haven't twigged to where all their hard earned taxes are going. lol."

Bought two extra hot chicken pieces and two medium fries. The chicken was terrible. Dry and tasteless. Fries were just soggy chips. I since looked online and there are hundreds or more complaints about exactly what we were sold and across Australia not just Maroochydore. The chicken was so overcooked there was no fluid to be had and it seemed like all the liquid drained out of the chicken was poured onto the soggy horrible fries. Goodbye forever KFC your once enjoyable fried chicken is terrible.

However the toilet cistern in the room took about 25 mins between flushes to refill, which is n't great when your have a family. If I knew about the problem beforehand, I would n't have stayed, it was that bad. Staff did offer to move us to another room however, the flush was equally as rubbish in the new room. The guest and paid for wifi were terrible too. I did report the issue to staff but this did n't fix the problem. There are n't any USB sockets in the room either so take a plug adaptor. On positive note the shower was great, it was hot and powerful also the a / c kept the room cool which was good as you ca n't open the windows. Overall I would n't recommend this inn, until the toilets, wifi and usb problems are fixed."

1. Spam public housing everywhere, like, literally everywhere, enough to cut wait list down to a minimal amount of time. And/or
2. Protect renters, right now we treat them like dirt, if we protect them there will be a bunch of long term renters which reduces demand to buy, and therefore lower prices
Problem is, either or both of these will be viciously attacked by the media, the right wing pollies, and the ones who currently own assets (just look at poor bill who tried a gentle touch removal of negative gearing). Opinions will need to sway a lot more for any of this to happen."

But the full saying finished with something about our leaders squandering this ""luck"". which is absolutely true. Instead of leveraging our land and resources to produce goods, eliminating overilianc eon improtation and dominating international trade, we just export our raw resources for bottom dollar for the short term  financinal and political gain of indivduals.

We used the cereal packet tokens..... still cost an absolute fortune. It was busy, there was a wait to get in and pay and then it was packed throughout. And the reason that is is because the place is tiny!! I was n't expecting the size of the American one but oh lord it was so small. We walked through a few little alley ways with some fish displays. There is one main room with lots of displays and a cafe and again it was small and so again it was packed full of stressful parents with the same pained look on their faces. The cafe was ridiculously overpriced and little choice, but as they have you in there you have little choice but to stomach it as there are no other options. My son enjoyed the jelly fish display and the shark display the most. The walk through the tunnel under the turtles was probably the best bit but again was very short. Maybe spent an hour if that in there. Would n't go again, not to the Brighton one anyway. Save your money it's not worth the hype."

Those rights should not extend to protection from subjective hurt feelings but to objective harms.
It's incumbent on society to educate the people to be more resistant to the effects of subjective hurt feelings, but to act against objective harm.
Free speech can never be objective harm because it has no objective agency and is entirely dependent only on the actions of the recipient. There is no freedom of action because it has direct objective harm consequences."

Wait time is less. Tables are placed at a good distance so everyone has a good level of privacy. Best to make reservations if going in a group. They have a kids play area to keep the young ones busy but sitting in that area can be noisy. Food was beautifully presented but taste would be a 4 on 5 for me as I have had better. Their silken tofu was not up to the mark. I would still go here to have Thai food

This was my first and last time coming here. When I walked in, there were a number of staff to the left and out the back where their ovens were and one younger girl at the counter. As soon as I walked in, all I got was stares and scowls as best I could describe the staff to the left and out towards the ovens. Not a smile on any of them despite my holding their stare for moments. Obviously not friendly people nor happy to work at this place. After a moment the young girl turned to serve me and gave a nice smile which was a great improvement. I ordered two almond croissants, looked at the other stuff they had but still feeling unwelcome by the scowls of the other staff, I wanted out of there as quick as I could. Forget coffees or any other pastries to try. I even rang the wife and told her never to ask me to go to that place again. Then when I got home, we sat on our balcony to enjoy my purchase. Two bites into my croissant, a hair was stuck inside the filling. I paid 7 or 8 dollars each for these things and a hair, in the filling. At least that tells you a lot about their food handling skills. Made me sick. What a waste of money and a terrible experience. Wake up to yourselves. First thing I did was checked google reviews and started at the lowest first and sure enough, this seems to be a common thing with the staff sub-service and apologies from the owner that they will talk to the staff. Obviously the staff are n't listening. The 2 stars I gave were for the smile the young girl at the counter gave. Zero stars for the scowls by the other staff and the hair in your food."

After few hours we had gone out( we did n't ask for our rooms to be cleaned) even though we had told them not to clean our room they still did it. When we got back to the hotel we saw that our room was clean, later on checked all our luggage and saw few things were missing from the luggage and purse, such as( travelling Iron, Body cream, Face wash, MAC Lipstick, money, Handcream, Jewelry Box) after confirming everything, we had gone down to the lobby and asked for manager and reported this issue to him. The manager reassured us that this issue will be sorted, and he will ask the cleaners( they had gone home as their shift had finished) the next day we checked out and spoke to the manager he said that he called the cops and mentioned that the cleaners declined everything about stealing from us to the cops and they maintained their innocence until the end.( Even though there was CCTV camera). At the end the manager gave us some discount. If you stay at this hotel pls make sure to lock all your valuables away.( Take pic if necessary) End of the day they are still working there."

What's even more amusing is that d'Arbrera attempts to describe the current curriculum as something terrible when it sounds fine. Secondary school students are told about atrocities under colonisation and invited to consider which were deliberate. Heaven forbid we teach kids about facts and foster critical thinking!

Again.
Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 
**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.
The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 
When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed International Tribunal Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ICTY 
This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial. 
The right thing has happened; the ICJ was involved. Australia's best bet is to let that play out, and make sure politically and legally ignorant senators don't say the kind of stupid shit normally reserved for horrifically unqualified redditors on the topic, lest someone take them seriously."

During the really bad flooding situation we ",0,"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 
During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.
My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 
Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 
We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 
And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 
Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.
Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable. Like the fight they had about cleaning the exterior with a pressure washing company. Owners didn't want to... Strata told them we are doing it either comply and pick a company yourself or we will and you'll be fined, there mold growing lol"

The theatre has 4 screens, out of which sakthi murugan is the smallest screen whereas others are big and medium big screens. Seating is also good and ticket price is very affordable which is 130. Parking available, but a bit congested. They charge 20 for bikes for one show. The restrooms are not that hygienic, should definitely take a look on it. Here, only Cash & Card accepted, no UPI payments, which is a very major drawback and more over that, they charge fees for payments using cards. Murugan Cinemas is available in Ticket New App for online bookings."

High wages defenitely afflict high rise builders though especially in victoria. 
But what does my head in is the liberals are all over this new car tax and yet they introdiced GST on homes, then mainly labor state governments introduced developer levies, councils more charges. 
So we have liberals crying foul on a 15k impost on 4x4s but then the 150k plus in taxes from homes - 15bn odd per annum we dont say the same - what does this 150k do to the proce of all homes.
To my mind it is a bigger issue of justice and equality that homes are made more expensive by tax than 4x4s and i drive and holiday in 4x4s. 
Why is this not on the radar? Why can we go; congrats labor spending 2bn on supply while we milk 15bn back out as generous to prospective first home buyers. 
I mean we are literally putting a tax on these 4x4s of 15k to discourage them but then dont care we have 150k odd on a new home and wonder where is the supply."

If you aren't allowed to do a nazi salute or wave a swastika, you shouldn't be allowed to openly support terrorists who want to kill Jews either. What's the problem with that?
Edit: And to be clear the Sydney opera house incident wasn't overblown, it was manipulated to grab attention, which is inexcusable. But they were still saying ""fuck the Jews"" and ""where's the Jews"" while trying to find a group of Jewish people that had gathered at the opera house, which I'd argue is more threatening."

The garlic bread was the same size as the pizzas and it was very good; had alot of flavour and was tasted great. Service was average. Nothing bad by any means. Nothing to set it apart from other places though. The atmosphere was quite calm and it certainly made the experience better as it allowed for the enjoyment of the food. I would go again; during the week in quiet times I think is best.

Nothing complicated 2 bacon rolls and a sausage baguette to collect in 25 mins so plenty of time. Got there bang on the dot to be told I not even looked at you order yet mate. Waited 5 mins then told doing it now. Then told sorry no sausages cooked going to be at least 7 mins  you only do 2 times on your breakfast menu how hard can it be to know you have to cook them. I asked them to cancel the sausage baguette as I ca n't wait, this created utter confusion as to how I can get my money back as I ordered on the app. They keep telling me they would just put extra bacon on the sausage baguette Finally got cash back from the till and left with bacon rolls. At least my wife n son get breakfast."

The place was bustling with life and it's a great place for families or travelling on your lonesome. There's lot of food shops that sell fresh produce at reasonable prices. There's also a lot of boats for hire and trips available. I did find one or two locals who were not overly fond of outsiders, but only muttered under their stanky breath as they did n't have the guts to say it to anyone face."

There was noise in my room from the outside. I'm not sure what it was but I still managed to have a great night sleep. There was not a huge amount of choice for the breakfast. Small amounts of everything you would expect. Hash browns, scrambled eggs, beans, bacon and sausage available buffet style as a hot choice. Some cheese and meat the pastries were on a single tray covered by a tea towel away from the main breakfast with no label so I missed them till I left. Still you could have as much tea coffee and orange juice as you would like. All of the food I had was really good too. Staff were really helpful and friendly! Overall I found the price was really good the location was brilliant. I would definitely return."

It was mouthwatering feeling, so I searched for this place everywhere. Somedays before in Instagram I saw the new branch of this Shop in kannur, but I was not sure that all items will be available or not. So I took phone number from Google and made call but it connected to Thalassery branch. Even I made call to enquire about kannur branch they were very customer friendly and clarify my all enquiries. So we decided to go. We reached there by 0900pm in the night, shop opens till 10 in the night. In ground floor only cakes are available, there are a variety of cakes in different flavours. Dine-in were arranged in the first floor. Staircase is very steep, i do n't prefer old people to visit here coz no seating is arranged in the ground floor. Interior were very welcoming. Table was nicely arrange to sit 4 or 5 person. We ordered Eiffel tower and Jabulani delight. Both costs _ each. Eiffel tower is the combination of cakes and Icecreams. First 3 layer is icecreams and other are cakes. At top of the tower there is a ferroro Rocher placed. Presentation of both were amazing and mesmerizing one. Jabulani delight is also a mixture of cakes and Icecreams. It's loaded with nuts and dryfruits. One thing I suggest everyone is please order this 2 item if you are of groups of four and above else you people will be trapped, because it's such a huge one comparatively."

It is hard to believe such stupidity has been allowed to manifest it's way in Australia's political class.   Is it because so many of them no longer have ever worked a real job and have been professional politicians all their life?
If you look at the upper leadership of all political parties, how many of them have ever worked real jobs?  It is no wonder Australia is headed down the path of being eventually on this path taken over by another country."

But there's normally a wait here. Fresh and good quality topping is used. The crust is just the right amount. But the taste differs sometimes. Service is good. Even the prices are low( Try the veg singles @ 80 only!!). The only drawback is they do n't clean the tables immediately customers have to wait until the tables get cleaned and ample amount of tissue papers are not provided. Rest everything is just perfect.

It's not m",0,">However, no such limits on general project expenditures when agency temps are involved.
It's not much of a stretch to say that for a ""short term one-off"" project you don't want to add public servant FTEs that then need to be served a redundancy when the project completes.
  
It's a lot harder to justify when you have:
\* project teams that move directly to the next project in the queue when their current one winds up
\* long term rollover contracts for ongoing service provision
  
The argument I do see that is hard to counter (currently) is high-demand contributor skills where the PS position is not paid that well, as the higher pay grades are for managers and directors+, so the only way to get those people are to offer high-paying contracts.  
  
If there was an individual contributor paygrade that went higher that might counter that issue."

When Labour aren't campaigning to rejoin the EU, they can effectively attack the Government on their failure to do what they promised and what people wanted. When they campaign to rejoin the EU, the position flips, and the Conservatives can again make the argument to do all the stuff that they aren't actually doing. 
The far more sensible strategy is to win power, demonstrate to left behind voters that the government is actually committed to helping them and can be trusted, and then explain why rejoining would offer this better than remaining outside.
Unfortunately, that requires a lot of work. A lot of remainers care enough to tweet, but get quite bored at the prospect of actually coming up with a good solution for the parts of the country they don't actually give a shit about."

>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The ",1,"Mining:    
>The way the tax incentives are designed at the moment is a little bit concerning. The one for critical minerals allows you a tax credit for 10 percent of your operating costs, but it's available for existing facilities as well as new ones. And it doesn't have a requirement for those facilities to improve the emissions intensity of their production.    
Super Tax Breaks:    
>They probably don't involve the same degree of economic costs. They have sort of distributional consequences that are attractive given rising wealth inequality, and they do sort of reorient the intergenerational bargain, which is fraying. And so, the big one, the biggest hole is super tax breaks. So, they're costing 45 billion a year.
>It's about 2 percent of GDP. They'll pretty soon cost more than the age pension. They're obviously not very well targeted. Half the benefits flow to the wealthiest one fifth of households. I put these in two buckets. There's the bucket of things that you could probably take to an election at this point and be fairly confident it's not going to hurt you too much.
>And that is title limits on pretax contributions. It's raising the tax rate on some of those pre-tax contributions through division 293 tax that would reduce the use of super as a tax minimization tool. And if you do those, there's 3 or 4 billion dollars a year of sort of policies there that really trimming at the top end.
>And then the elephant in the room is the fact that as soon as you hit age 60, you're not going to pay any tax on your earnings. You basically had to check out of the tax system and that's costing Australians billions of dollars or the government billions of dollars a year. And that's not really sustainable in the long term.    
NDIS:   
>Yeah, look, and look, this is always the thing when you see an expenditure category that's growing faster than the economy and then a tax category that's growing slower than the economy, you know, you know, you've got something you've got to reckon with this sort of mismatch between how much we're willing to pay.
>At the outset of the NDIS, there was a really important you know, piece of thinking around how by supporting people through the scheme effectively you support them to, into employment and that's part of how the scheme starts to pay for itself. Was this an erroneous assumption or do we think this is still something that the scheme can achieve? [they lean towards it being largely erroneous].       
Housing:   
>I think that's a great question. And the issue here is that like sitting at the heart of this problem is the fact that we haven't built enough. That's why housing in part is so expensive. It's not the only factor, but it's certainly a factor that we have some control over. And if we shifted the dial on housing supply has a whole bunch of other really positive benefits for the economy.    
Healthcare:   
>As the Commonwealth faces more pressures on its budget as well, you see in the health system or in terms of disability supports, you see each government try and push the problem onto the other level of government. And so, you see you know, we, we've seen historically, the Commonwealth has tried to cut down its expenditure in primary care or in preventative care.    
>And leave the states to carry the consequences of that in terms of growth in hospitals. Or in the case of the NDIS, you see the conversation around what are some of those foundational supports that people will get in schools or other state-based settings. And as the states have less money to spend, they're going to be less cooperative in, in, in those conversations.
>And I think this comes back to the fact that Australian Federation wasn't well designed on the tax side. We've got a deep vertical fiscal imbalance with responsibilities for services sitting with the states, downstream services sitting with states, but taxation power sitting overwhelmingly with the Commonwealth.
Job Seeker:
>Look, it's a really tough one, because I think it's clear that we need the rise. So, JobSeeker for a long time has been well below the level that I think allows people to be empowered to go and find work as well as survive.
>If they're on that payment for a while, we've seen increases for originally from the Coalition and then in Labor last year. That mean that the payments gone up by 45 a week in real terms. Our position had always been it needed to rise by at least 100 a week. So, we're still 55 dollars a week away from that. I could have imagined a world where we did more of that."

I live near McKinnon but am in the Glen Eira College zone and the socioeconomic demographics between the two areas are pretty much identical but McKinnon is seen as something to aspire to while Glen Eira is (generally) seen as ""good enough"". I don't get it. 
Australia's education system is so messed up in so many ways but the most appalling aspect of our education system is this class divide that only seems to be worsening. Private schools receiving government funding is sickening, then even within the public system there are gross inequities. The whole thing needs a massive shake up but of course that won't happen because people are terrified of acknowledging the issues within the education system, let alone actually doing something about said issues.
Rant over, I've been pissed about all of this since I finished high school nearly ten years ago lol"

From outside, this theatre looks like an old one but inside it will really keep us in a comfortable zone. The sound system is something that one should experience. And picture clarity is also 4k. But not sure whether it is Dolby Atmos or not. Ticket cost is 150 rupees for the whole seats in this theatre. Toilets are also clean. For this lengthy theatre, the screen size is less. And seats are also not movable but partially comfortable. This is what I felt negatives in this theatre. And coming to the snacks, even for the second show burgers are available and prices are also not so high."

Then there is the Scandanavian bloc where mental health is seen as a treatable condition at hospitals, free ambulance services are provided and there has been a massive reduction in stigma overall. But this has been affected by COVID and loneliness around the world.
While things do move forward, progressive movements move at a snails pace, while one regressive incident, where the police were already aware, may set the whole movement forward back again introducing new fear by the acts of one person, who may later be misrepresented by the fears of others... It's seen easier to jerk a knee then to provide a humane and dignified response to this issue."

Could be a bath left on, fire sprinkler, Flexi hose burst, burst pipe in wall etc. the main floor thats burst will need floors replaced, the other floors wil probably just need hallway carpet dried. Lift shaft will likely be fine.
The comments about cost and not buying in this building are ridiculous. This will almost certainly be covered by insurance - either strata, individual or builders. A few people will be put out, almost all will be fine."

It made us feel like we should have walked out in embarrassment. We were there to eat. No direction from bar staff, we just stumbled upon the menu while being stared at from the bar. We then just wondered around before discovering where to order, by the same staff member that stared at us. The tables were grotty and old and the seats had more stains on them than a 20 year old chair. I then went to order drinks, big mistake. Female staff member stared at me again while they tendered to another customer. I waited over 5 minutes after being stared at. At about minute 4, some guy walked in and sat at the bar. How rude I was to think I was to be served first. Shame on me. I was passively aggressively ignored until their needs were met and then finally served at a sloths pace. Bar staff did n't care at all. The chefs special laksa for 31 was so bland, I could n't finish but half of it. The BLAT burger was the only save. We wo n't be back."

The library will actually be expensive to run with many textbooks costing several hundred pounds each. 
Salaries of postdocs, PhD scholarships they will fund some of. Lecturer and professor salaries and pensions arent that cheap.  
Lab equipment, maintenance of the more fancy machines usually come with expensive service packages. Consumables in the lab are insanely expensive as well. 
Running certain courses are certainly expensive and from my experience in science, it's not cheap.  
There are a lot of predatory business that charge universities extortionate amounts of money. Look up how much they pay annually to academic journals alone and I think you'll be shocked."

Going on recommendations from over a year ago I booked. The service was good no complaints there but the food was very sub standard. The starters were ok and the crispy duck was fine. However cutting it up directly outside a toilet is a no no! This I never knew about until I got home and was told. If I had known it would have been sent back. All the mains were tasteless undercooked or overcooked unless your a sugar fanatic this place is not for you. Very disappointed indeed. Will not be returning.

If they aren't then many would be breaking the law. We accept it because we know legally the business often do (yes I'm sure some businesses aren't but still do) have a higher wage bill on weekends due to having to pay time and a half or double time to staff. And double time is that, double your base wage. Make $23 a hour on Friday it can be $46 an hour on Sunday.
And why shouldn't staff be paid for having to work unsocialable hours. Unlike the US our culture is work to live not live to work. So yes in Australia in some industries (It used to be nearly all industries but Jackboot Johnny killed that off) do have higher costs in wages fir weekends/public holidays etc."

There was a great selection of tea, coffee and biscuits provided in the suite. The staff were all lovely, the breakfast was great, and the location is fantastic. I was on the top floor, which was lovely and quiet. I felt like I was the only person staying on that floor, which is a testament to how peaceful it was! However, whoever had cleaned the room prior to my check in had left the windows open( in February!) so it was freezing cold. After shutting the windows and plugging in the two small electric heaters provided, the room was still VERY cold during the whole of my stay. The underfloor heating was on but there were no controls in the room to turn it up. Whenever I was in my room, I had to get under the bed covers and keep both heaters beside me to take the edge off the chill. There were no extra blankets provided in the room. Easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in, but had to knock off a star due to the cold."

The location has several restaurants with similar names along the same row, but this restaurant is mainly for Chinese delicacies. The food is decent here, and one can easily reach the location from Kalyani station. Veg as well as non-veg items are available, being an ideal restaurant to grab chinese food. During the rush hours, especially during lunchtime, it may seem a bit crowded and getting a table may seem unlikely at first, but the staff is helpful in arranging one at the earliest.

Where else do we accept someone dressing up as being something to ""celebrate""? Its like someone dressing up as a pirate or an astronaut to ""live their authentic selves"" being seen as heroic. 
Imagine someone claimed to be Japanese and dressed in traditional Japanese clothes every day and a group of people set themselves up to ""celebrate"" how Japanese they truly were and supported 45 year old men dressing in Japanese clothing reading to children in order to help validate their Japaneseness. 
I clearly have too literal a mind and think too straight. I just see a man dressing how a teenage boy thinks a certain type of female that teenage boys imagine exist dresses. I just cannot pretend hard enough and get on board with this movement. I guess this makes me deeply immoral in modern culture."

From where I'm sitting, HOAs seem like a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. For maintenance of roadsides and the like we've got councils, and aside from planning regulations they don't really impose too much on what you do on your own property. 
I think if I were subject to the whims of an HOA I'd hate it more than I hate strata."

So if we divert around 12 years of what we are spending in infinitum to subsidise renewables annually, it would pay to replace our entire coal station fleet with nuclear and provide us what the article describes as 89% continuous capacity. 
12 years of funding for 60 years of 89% capacity sounds like a good deal to me. We don't need to mine the buggery of the earth for battery minerals nor litter the land with panels, batteries and wind turbines."

How can domestic violence be a valid priority when more women and children die on the roads, if indeed death is the primary determinant of the program?
I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.
It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.
Surely the focus should be on the worst triaged objective outcomes, not subjective hurt feelings; and on men who kill, not profiling all men for the actions of a minority.
Didn't we ban gay conversion therapy only to now implement a generic Men's Behaviour conversion therapy? Behaviour is in response to causative factors, it doesn't magically spring into being through immaculate conception. Perhaps we should be looking at causative factors in priority outcomes."

The fact we have freedom of speech to discuss any policy idea is irrelevant and an attempt to obfuscate. 
How can anything be costed or tested, how can any investment even begin to be courted, while there is a ban? Why would a project proponent even start, or devote one iota of time and resources to it?
Your comments are just excuses, and the excuses keep shifting. Clearly, nuclear is successfully deployed all around the world, reducing carbon emissions. How come that reality isn't just slapping you in the face? How can you continue to claim it's untenable when reactors actually exist? 
Look what the Canadians did. It's fantastic. It's high tech. It's job-creating. It's good for energy security. And it fits with a centralised energy grid, complementing renewables through providing grid stability. 
Look what the IEA says:
""Nuclear power accounts for about 10% of electricity generation globally, rising to almost 20% in advanced economies. It has historically been one of the largest global contributors of carbon-free electricity and while it faces challenges in some countries, it has significant potential to contribute to power sector decarbonisation.""
Why are we denying ourselves this important technology?Just please, get off the ideological band wagon. Utilise your brain and stop repeating party lines, you will be better for it."

To those who just listen to commercial media they've been brainwashed with ""LNP are the best economic managers"" propaganda since 1996. 
For instance I know someone who voted ALP last election, with the justification of ""I'm voting ALP because I hate Scomo and want him gone but Liberals are the best economic managers so I'll probably vote for them in 2025 because I don't want Labor stuffing up the economy for too long"". When i tried to show him all the actual facts he refused, it was all ""c'mon mate Labor are just a bunch of wannabe socialists who spend all our money and get us into debt, the Libs have their bad points but EVERYONE knows the Libs are the best economic managers""
The same guy who railed about ""Labor breaking their promise!"" on the stage 3 tax cut even though he himself got a larger cut than he would've under the Liberals. There's some people you can't help"

Visited three to four times here. Inside ambience was good. Bengali recipes are too good. Not all but some chicken recipes could be better. Cleanness and other services are also nice. Parcel and online order are also taken. Overall it's a restaurant.

I don't know what to do, tbh. I went to fairwork + I've been paid properly (bc they obviously don't want a full investigation happening) but my coworkers are still fucked. i've watched people break down and cry on shift multiple times.
Who do you even go to about this? And is it even right to? No one speaks explicitly, obviously, but people have told me stuff in their home countries isn't great, the AUD is strong there, etc so I can kinda read between the lines. So even if I did expose things I might just be making things worse for them? I don't even know"

There's a lot of untrue stereotypes in this thread except for a few which are for the most part true (bearing in mind that it's a population of over 300 million people and there are vast regional differences.)
Americans don't dry clothes on the clothesline and will always use a dryer. 
Americans use air conditioning all the time so need to dust quite often. And then in the winter central heating will blow dust everywhere too so the dusting never stops. 
Americans tend to use more disposable plates and cups, but it tends to be lower income people who do this. But that said - I would agree that most Americans are generally less conscious of the environment. Paper towels for everything. Disposable wipes. Disposable mops like Swiffers. Disposable dusters. 
And lastly- this is a town by town basis but it seems like recycling is half hearted at best. I recycle at home but honestly I'm skeptical the bottles and glasses are cardboard I sort into different bins is actually recycled.
Edit to add: almost everyone I know owns a kettle. I don't know where this stereotype comes from other than people taking the piss."

Since you are so concerned about money.
You must absolutely hate LNP handling of the economy and our taxes. A decade of debt growth never seen before covid. Year on year deeper into debt. Never once a budget that reduces it. Only grew it. Oh and this is all before covid. So no excuses. Just utter rubbish Financial Managers. 
Are you overjoyed at ALP being back in power and stop wasting our money?"

Another employee inside, the Portuguese bartender lady, is also smiling with patience and I really like that she does her job with love thank you very much"

I went for the parmigiana to start which was well balanced and simply scrumptious. For my main I tried the rigatoni alla boscailo which was a mushroom pasta with a gorgonzola and cream sauce. Vegetarian pasta frequently disappoints especially when on a set menu but this certainly did not. You will find great service in Mamma Rosa and it is so nice to find a decent Italian restaurant a stone throw from home.

That's simple chemistr,0,"It takes 1.6 units of electrical energy to produce 1 unit of hydrogen energy. That's simple chemistry and it can't be changed anymore than you can change the fact that if you set fire to wood you will get hear and light. But then you have to spend more energy refrigerating the hydrogen, and it's so cold it embrittles the pipes etc which have to be frequently replaced, it leaks and so on.
In the Space Shuttle programme, only 55% of the liquid hydrogen was actually burned in the rocket engines - the rest was lost in transit, evapourated in storage and so on. 12.6% was lost simply transferring it from a tanker truck to a storage tank.
So then you are in effect spending 1.6 x 1/0.55 = 2.91 units of energy to get 1 unit of useful hydrogen. Of course, we might suppose that we are going to be more efficient and effective than an agency which has half a century of experience handling liquid hydrogen and has spent billions of dollars trying to make it more efficient and effective, but this seems unlikely.
This only works if we have some massive surplus of renewable electricity which we have no other use for, so that we don't care that most of it is wasted in the process. Given that fossil fuels are still being used for about 2/3rds of the country's electricity, this seems unlikely to happen in the near future.
At the moment, the ""green hydrogen"" movement is simply a way for mining companies to squeeze more money from the public revenue. If it's genuinely useful it doesn't need subsidies. If it needs subsidies it's not useful."

As this is a new cafe and do n't get too busy they will get plenty of time to chat but as a customer I expect to be served as I enter. However, I am more than happy to wait on the queue if there is other customers in front of me. Just been to this cafe() and ordered a coffee. I waited for 10 minutes, even the people who ordered after me were served but my ordered did not show up. I approached a staff and she found an empty cup with my name, prepared the drink and served me but NO SORRY. Customer service is genuinely needs to improve."

The grotto experience was delightful and the staff were fantastic. The Father Christmas was the most authentic Ove ever seen, he was so lovely and amazing with the children. The Ferris wheel enables us to experience a unique view of Tunbridge Wells. I would recommend this as a Christmas family activity."

The haddock was very good but the rest of the food was bad, it's hard to tell wether the food was not cooked right, the quality of food was poor or because we had to reheat it. When calling Ocean Trawler and explaining that the delivery driver is lost there answer is "" not our problem "" and their right just eat is another organisation all together but they obviously do n't have any interest in wether their customers get their food or not.

Firstly, if you are going to accuse me of wildly engaging in misinformation, it would be nice if you did me the courtesy of reading what I write until you comprehend it.
Both the judge and I distinguished between the cases deemed most comparable and those that were simply mentioned. One of the cases that was merely mentioned was about a lawyer stealing $220 000 from a disabled client (which is a lot worse than blowing the whistle), another that was merely mentioned was about stealing work tools. You've skimmed the conclusion of the judgment and cherry picked the least relevant and in one case most evil cases you could find.
I can't take you seriously if you pretend it's a coincidence the sentencing was held on budget day. That and the harshness of the sentence despite all the considerations I've listed are evidence of the judge's bias.
The Nazis obeyed orders and Stanislav Petrov disobeyed them, those are my points.
As his new lawyer will argue in court, he had duties that prevailed to the extent of any other duty. He could not have held his position as a military lawyer without having this duty. The proceedings in the High Court will shed light on this and most likely result in McBride being exonerated or at least given a better sentence for a whistle blower.
It's a lot easier to prove illegal procedures in investigating cases before you, than to prove cases of war crimes your superiors don't want you to see. If you look at the extracts of McBride's statements to police in the sentencing transcript, they will shed light on his motivations.
His previous lawyers took a very limited approach in defending David. Perhaps Mark Davis saw this case too much like a journalist (which he was) and that is why he didn't devote his time to making contingency plans in case his main argument was dismissed.
You are referencing the defense department investigating itselfwhen McBride concerns were with the leadership of the defense department.
I heard about the contents of the documents from people who have read them.
I heard the judge admit the contents of the leaked documents were of public interest."

Even pedestrians just stepping out into bike lanes like on Swanston St are a massive hazard. I wouldn't be without my helmet personally. But I recognise that's my choice.
I think they should be compulsory up to the age of 18. Peer pressure being what it is means kids will definitely bully their peers for wearing a helmet if it's not compulsory, and being less risk-averse naturally, we're guaranteed to end up with a lot more teenaged brains splashed on our roads if they're made optional."

If you go to a hospital beforehand seeking help you will be turned around and be told to use the privatised system.
Want to see an actual psychologist long term for a clinical condition indefinitely?  Once you hit your 10 sessions you pay entirely out of your own pocket.
It's a dimly lit road, it creates its own chaos and then ironically?
Even where the chain of causality is unbroken and the government is responsible for its own mess when a man stabs over 20 people, while there are laws to punish the doctors involved with medical negligence, at a criminal level, leading to a manslaughter charge... the knives are turned on the community as a whole instead. Ironically, the entirety of Queensland Health was aware who that person was hence the causality.
What I have learned is that the government is great at knee jerk reactions, and coming up with bad responses as a result.
But to be proactive, or even retroactive and to deal with the problem from where it stems from in the lack of interest in providing clinical care, or prosecuting those that allow for these lapses? That's a nigh on impossibility, even when the cases, and reasons for action are plonked directly in the face of governments that continue the harm...
I don't have all the answers but I have one, and it would start by holding the director of Queensland Health to account for the negligent homicide of 20 innocent people in Sydney last month and rooting out every bad practitioner that refuses to treat.
Maybe that's a tough road but at this point its what it deserves...
Those types of actions are beginning in the United States through civil action such as the actions into the wrongful death of Tony Timpa, but more widespread action needs to be taken and healthcare practitioners need to be held to account for the clusterfuck of a situation they themselves have created even if they claim the duress of not having enough funding.
On that note, not having enough funding never means:
""Blame the patient...""
But clinicians attempt to assert that repeatedly nevertheless.
""Blame the patient for turning up with a mental health complaint (or outsource it to some third party that may or may not give a fuck)."

Yes, but let's not forget most of the blame is still with the government.
1. The referendum was not legally binding and the amount of people who came out against the result should of been cause for pause and more discussion.
2. They did not have to trigger article 50 straight away. Could of actually worked out what Brexit might look like and present that to the public before doing anything.
The referendum should of been, ""ok the public want to leave EU. Let's see what that looks like"". Not ""the public want to leave the EU, let's go NOW"""

If you like the pubs just try some other nikes? In my experience most of them are pretty comfy. Ignore all the sad cunts, idk why everyone is so pissed off about a reformed eshay who still likes his shoes"

The hotel was fully booked and I feel as though the room we were given should n't of been offered to guests. It smelled like dank, musty cigarette which we could still smell on our clothes in our suitcases when we got home, there was visible dust on the TV cabinet, and on the first night, our air conditioner did n't work. The next morning the Manager( who was quick to respond to our request) came up to our room to inspect and kicked the unit to get it working again. At least it worked. Not only was the hotel in bad shape, but the city too. There is a TAB just downstairs from the accommodation which attracts the wrong types of people. My son( age 7) dodged a bicycle being thrown in his direction from one of the TAB patrons who was yelling and swearing at another patron, they were about to get into a physical altercation. We crossed the road very quickly! We felt very unsafe. The city is housing many who are doing it tough and sleeping rough and on my morning walk, all I could smell was human urine. I wo n't be staying at this hotel or in the CBD for some time after this experience."

Unfortunately the floor manager was rude from the get go, greeting us with a "" where are you going ? You ca n't just sit you need to go to the desk "" however there is no wait to be seated sign and no one waiting to greet you on entry. We ordered the mixed grill and asked to swap some sides( same price on the sides menu) was told this was n't allowed by manager. The young man serving us was great, very friendly and checked us multiple times we were n't left waiting. The food was average, bland and had no flavor. The seasoning on meats was basic to none, if you like the taste of straight unseasoned meat this place is for you. The coleslaw and creamy garlic sauce had no flavor at all. We did n't even end up finishing our ribs. Overall very sad experience overall for a rib and steak joint. Not worth the prices when a steak from coles with nothing but pepper and salt has more flavor."

I had the three course special for 20. The starter was half of a large mushroom with salad. I felt that they could have stretched to a full mushroom however. I had a veg curry for mains and the curry flavour was lovely. I had the cheese & crackers for the third course which was lovely. The cheapest wine was a bottle and that was very nice. It was my birthday and I was given a plate with happy birthday written across it which was a lovely touch. It was a nice treat for a special occasion.

I imagine the experience is completely different from an able bodied perspective but as a wheelchair user this was a challenge for sure. To start there is n't really anywhere that close that's reliably available for disabled people. Some street parking is n't far away but it's a gamble if you're going for that route and tight on time for your movie. The cinema itself from the outside can easily be mistaken for a coffee shop with the scaffolding in place currently and the ODEON sign obscured. The entrance is fine but two sets of stairs down to the screen my film was showing in posed a small problem. I say small because without much of a chance to see if the lifts provided could be used independently I do n't know if you can make it down to that area without assistance. The biggest positive came from the staff who were very helpful and operated the lifts for me on both occasions without fuss or delay. One drawback is you can only fit one chair user in at a time and as I said I could n't try myself to see if you can use them without aid. The disabled toilet was disgusting, it did n't look like it had been cleaned all weekend( This was at 5 pm Sunday) and was quite small so not much room to maneuver. If you were somebody who needed a carer inside with you I can imagine it would be very troublesome. Then I made my way to screen 4 which on the website looked magnificent from the seating plan. A rare reserved area at the back in the middle for me to park in which was ideal. Unlike the usual options of front row and or on one side. The issue for me came with opening the door as there is a slope leading into the screen. Because of this I nearly ended up out the chair several times as my feet slipped out the chair due to leaning forward to open and try and get through the door. The quality of the screen was fine and everything outside the toilets was clean. Personally however I would not recommend this cinema to anyone else with mobility issues especially. It would be a case of needs must for me to visit again."

The callous neglect that society has for us is always on display and always sickens me.
There's no national debate on mining subsidies. There's hardly any national debate on the projected 7.7 billion that CGT will cost the budget, the 8 or so billion annually on negative gearing, about 12 billion a year on childcare subsidies, 9 billion for AUKUS, 4 billion on new missile facilities.
I could go on and on and on.
But sure, making it so those of us born with disabilities HAVE TO PROVE OUR WORTHINESS TO EXIST is the right thing to do.

Plating was gorgeous as well. Ordered a cocktail to share amongst 4 people which was more than sufficient. However, we ordered the steak and were not so impressed as it was a little tough and dry despite it being medium rare and rare. However, staff were apologetic and ready to replace the steaks on the house. We were very impressed by the service and will definitely be back again to try other things on the menu and the drinks."

Two things you should know, they're extremely energy efficient, and are built to European building code, not Australian - meaning they're neither freezing nor hot. This can't be understated enough how rare this is to have in Australia. This is a massive plus!
Secondly, not having a car space sucks... it just isn't practical. It wouldn't be a problem if the city was built for it, but it isn't. You will most likely feel trapped within the proximity of Melbourne's slow PT system.
But if you can make the car sacrifice, it's an easy choice. Personally, the only apartment I'd ever think of purchasing is a nightingale apartment."

We haven't legislated away the ability to put nuclear in front of the Australian people, but no one wants to seem to do it.The biggest nuclear advocates in Australia are currently refusing to reveal their costings, or where they think these power plants would be built, or who would build them, or when it could be done.
The legislation doesn't prevent nuclear from being put on the table, the cluster fuck that is nuclear costings and build times is what is preventing nuclear from being put on the table. The actual reality of nuclear is why the advocates aren't putting the details on the table.
And that's why people talk about it as an excuse to not do anything about climate change. Because it's loudest advocates don't actually seem interested in it, and because this detail less wailing just seems to further drag out the debate without adding an actual option."

We decided to go for the 10 inch wrap option which turned out to be a disaster. The contents within the wrap were non existent, over done chips and hardly any chicken or dressing. Staff require better training, one particular individual vanished when challenged about the quality of the food and service. I did get a refund for the food only, but never got offered a replacement or a full refund for all the meals due to the quality of service. Observe the pictures and judge for yourself.

One of our major political parties regularly dogwhistles racist tropes, including especially Sinophobia and Islamophobia.  We operate an offshore concentration camp for non-European refugees.    
  
Our much vaunted multiculturalism comes with imported and ancient feuds or every sort, proving that racism isn't the sole preserve of Caucasians.  Nor do Caucasians themselves stay away from insulting each others' origins; Irish/Jewish/Scottish/German/Italian/French joke, anyone?.  And our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have some pretty coarse nicknames for Polynesians and Indonesians.  
  
Why would anyone think Laura Tingle's comment was at all unusual?  Except, of course, to prevent a really talented journalist from maybe replacing a Murdoch shill as host of a current affairs programme?"

Two small RC with only one turned on is not going to heat a former church chapel and a projector screen slide of an open fire really does n't cut it. Unless the heating is improved it not the place to visit in Autumn and Winter unfortunately.

I've never found pan fried momos tasting so good. You can literally eat a packet of those and complete your supper. But you know, when it comes to price I'm a bit disappointed. It's overpriced.

Worse, three times I went by in my weeks in Edinburgh, the right shutter was kept shut. One can only guess if this is mechanical failure or just lack of trying at this point. Ocean Terminal generally gives the vibe of having given up, and it feels this cinema has, too. Shame, as it used to be a really fun place to go."

I would HIGHLY recommend against doing this on a ct110. You have sections where extended highway speeds are required and you will be under that. Lots of heavy vehicle traffic and angry drivers.
Edit:  I wanted to add to this now I'm not on my phone.  The section from Ceduna to Norseman is approximately 1200km during which you have basically no option other than traveling along the highway.  The highway itself has long sections where there is no paved ""breakdown"" lane to the side.  The edge of the lane is the edge of the paved surface.  In addition that highway carries a very large amount of heavy traffic, and loaded with supplies you're going to absolutely max out at 80kph and likely spend a lot of time under it.
You're going to be constantly overtaken by a mixture of very large trucks and grey nomads with caravans and you will have nowhere to go.  You will be stuck with no paved surface to ride on and either have to run onto the dirt, the surface of which is very inconsistent, or hope to hell you don't get smooshed as they overtake.
The only way I would consider this run on a CT is if I resigned myself to do 40kph the whole way on the dirt edge.  And frankly, as someone who LOVES insane distance riding, fuck that."

People are open to it because, ""I only get it for the specials"",  but they are very effective at exposing people to products they werent even considered, and weaving those products into peoples long term buying habits.
This is why Aldi repeat products on a regular cycle.
Their catalogue may not sell this time around, but each time around it becomes more and more likely.
Eventually they train people to keep an eye out for that special. And this is despite the fact they would never have considered that product 12 months ago.
But people only get the catalogue for the specials  .. . . ."

It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.
So we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.
What I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle. Deep dive into who YOU are - not what you're told to be, and there's always an answer. Then just say yes."

Gourmet hotdog Mexican dog my foot it had 1 bean a couple bits of corn and a dirty boiled hotdog you get in a 12 pack from woollies and the roll was not much better and not even warmed very disappointing for 9.

Kier is an absolute dictator. He's kicked out so many MPs from the party. Diane abbott, Jeremy Corbyn kicked out from the party. Anyone left wing is gone. He's going to kick out more if he wins a landslide. I wish the left in this country were more organised and formed their own party. Workers party will only stand in a couple of constituencies."

If you want us to have a republic, then it's your job to come up with a model people actually want, to get your MPs to present it to parliament, and then to get a majority of voters in a majority of states support it. 
I don't need to do anything to keep my King. He's with us until republicans get their shit together and present a better alternative. Which means he's with us for the life of the Commonwealth of Australia, since the republicans can only ever choose alcoholics and lefty sportspeople and failed ALP MPs as their leaders, so they'll never come up with an inspiring vision.
Love live the King!"

Knives, machetes, hammers, something like 12 onto the 2 unarmed guys. Everyone had a chop at them. So, in the end only 2 were charged, the two youngest involved who I believe were about 14. They got 4 years in youth detention and nobody else got anything. Standard way these shit heads operate is get the youngest to cop the charges. They do it too because they are then legends and have earned a good place in the crew. This was a good few years back so things might have changed somewhat."

They're rude, they argue with customers about how the customer wants their sandwich. They clearly do n't know nor have given much thought to how they make the product. Even though I live less than a minute from this store, more often than not, I will drive to Pialba or Torquay if I feel like a sub. I'll only go here if I can not afford the time. I was hoping when they did a refurb of the store recently they might take the opportunity to remedy the store failings, but clearly that did not happen."

The quality of the fries, which has been consistently subpar, seems to be deteriorating further. The customer service experience at the counter was notably poor, with the staff member displaying rudeness. Additionally, the beverage I ordered was served at only three-quarters of the cup capacity. I believe McDonald should prioritize substantial improvements in both customer service and food quality within the UK. The fries, in particular, have reached a point where they are barely edible."

Imo there needs to be a pretty serious discussion on the toxicity of sky ""news"" as an organisation..
Abc might occasionally be pro-labor, the Guardian aswell. But these organisations maintain a degree of civility in their reporting. 
Turn on any sky segment and you'll be met with the most vile language, laced with toxicity and venom. There is no civility in it, there is no decorum. Just pure disgusting narrativisation and crude character assassination tactics. 
It is not news, it is political toxic social engineering and should be seen for what it is, and addressed accordingly. 
That kind of toxicity is not good for a person's psyche and we can see its affects everywhere that Newscorp has its tendrils."

Definitely report to Fair Work, but I've had this happen (3-day trial, employer didn't pay) and I pursued it. I found out that was his modus operandi; he'd get people in for'trials' and boot them without pay, knowing most people will be shitty, but not do much about it.
If you hope to get paid, be prepared that it may not be easy. I note somebody else responded to go to the police be prepared for the employer to lie and possibly accuse you of theft or something else. 
You're best off getting proper advice from Fair Work and then deciding if it's worth it for you.
Best of luck."

1. Companies will struggle to get cheaper skilled labourers and will be forced to increase wages to attract them here in this country or start offering solutions to upskill. Seems like a positive to me.
2. Higher wages will attract more people towards those locations which will inevitably cause property to maintain their value in those locations, but free them up in other locations so end result is more available housing. Seems like a positive to me.

The messaging here is that even this results in addressing men's mental health, it isn't because society cares, it is because of men's violent and aggressive behavior. Which 1. Confirms their idea that society doesn't care about them, increasing negative sentiments toward the outside world. And 2, They get attention and help by being monsters. 
Nothing women beaters will love more than a Parliamentary Secretary for Men's Behaviour Change.  
  
People with aggressive and less than healthy relationship with masculinity are going to love the messaging of ""We are going to allocate a significant portion of our time and resources dedicated to changing who and what you are.""

Australian ecologist here: my god, there is a lot of rubbish being touted in this thread.
Okay, first up: there are not more dangerous animals in Australia then elsewhere. This is a misconception fueled by silliness and exoticism. The famous list of Australia having nearly all of the world's most venomous snakes comes from a terrible LD50 study that only used five or so overseas snakes for comparison. To get a more accurate impression of relative venom toxicity, check out Dr Bryan Greig Fry's LD50 page.
For the question of why we have so many venomous snakes here to begin with, one has to look at the dispersal of snakes within Australia. First there was the best snakes of all (fact), the Aspidites-- primitive snakes that branched off the snake family before pythons evolved. Australia was pretty empty with just these guys around, so when the elapids came down from Asia, there was lots of space for them to diversify into. Elapids are very venomous snakes with fixed front fangs: cobras, mamba, etc. All venomous snakes in Australia are descended from these elapids.
Australia has pretty venomous snakes because they all came from highly venomous stock. Since elapids were the main game in town for so long, they diversified to take over all niches, from super-venomous (which get a lot of attention) to nearly lacking venom all together (which no-one pays much attention to!). So Australia has a diverse range of venomous snakes, not just highly venomous ones. Focusing on the big hitters and making ridiculous guesses as to why they're here is missing the bigger picture.
The very venomous sea snakes that we have are simply land elapids that diversified into the oceans.
Our spiders are not more venomous that those of anywhere else in the world. We haven't had a spider-bite fatality since the'50s, and even then it was children and the elderly that succumbed.
South America and Africa have many more venomous species than Australia, including more venomous lizards and venomous mammals (!).
Edit: I worked out some ratios of lethal snakes:non-lethal snakes for a few different countries here. Australia ain't so bad."

You could probably also get big economic GDP growth if you borrowed a lot of money and just spend spend spend, or sold a lot of assets like Howard and Keating for money to spend.
You could argue that ideally, we have to top out our population at some time, so constant GDP growth isn't necessary if our population stays the same and we stop putting more stress on the environment with never ending addiction to growth. Standard of living is not necessarily tied to GDP growth, especially if measured on a per capita basis."

So they don't have to wash plates at all, just throw them in the bin. Seems ludicrously wasteful. 
Same goes for things like disposable wipes for cleaning. Saw a ""swiffer"" when Costco opened in Perth for the first time and wondered what the heck is wrong with a broom/dustpan and brush and a mop? All can be reused many times over, not just wipe and toss. 
I mean, I can accept not everyone grew up with a bucket in the shower to put the water on the garden afterwards, and their mum yelling at them to turn the bloody tap off while brushing their teeth, heaven help you if you take longer than 3 minutes in the shower - but wasting water by having a 20 minute shower with the water running the whole time just seems idiotic."

We had three steaks cooked at varying levels( medium well to medium rare), and all were cooked beautifully. However, the steak itself was quite bland, which we felt could have benefited from additional or more seasoning. The standout of the meal surprisingly was the complimentary soft serve, which had a simple yet amazing flavour. The truffle mac and cheese was good too, and the beef dripping chips also tasted great. Overall a lovely dining experience, highly recommended!"

What Marles said is consistent with Australia's position for years. T,1,"What a load of absolute shite. What Marles said is consistent with Australia's position for years. The SCS is a massive global trade route and China militarising it is an issue for everyone.
Unilaterally cutting all trade would of course damage Australia - but it would also do a lot of damage to the Chinese economy. China tried its economic coercion campaign and all it did was demonstrate Australia's economic resilience and ability to diversify markets.
The raw imports China gets from Australia are essential to China's economy (which is struggling) - they cannot quickly substitute the proximity and scale of iron ore, coal, gas, lithium etc that they get from Australia.
All this cheerleading for China makes me want to throw up. Australia should absolutely be making its position on these matters clear - all this does is prove how sensitive China is on these matters."

It only exists because of the mainstream parties ignoring the issue and letting it get worse.
The left has abandoned normal Brits on this issue, which is forcing them to look to the right for an answer.
The sole reason the right is growing in mainland Europe, Ireland, Canada and the US is because of the left's insane immigration stance."

If you want a good base to put yourself while you explore,  you could try places like Newcastle, Port Stephens, Forster, Coffs Harbour, Byron Bay, Tweed Heads, Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast if you stay in the east.  Western Australia has the best beaches,  though,  so if that's going to be your focus, you could look at Perth, Fremantle, Bunbury, Esperence, Margaret River. Western Australia is isolated from the rest of the country,  though.  It takes a 4 hour unreliable domestic flight to get to the east and it's a long way between cities."

I love their nasi goreng( Indonesian or Malaysian fried rice) and the available choice of pad thai sauce for the'' plate is another appeal for me. Their sushi choices, although limited, are very good as well, with the best value for money you can ever find around Greater Manchester. All their food items are nice, but the portions are slightly small, and have actually decreased in volume, throughout the course of the past two years( since it moved to its current location). Still, with the good prices, it has great value for money, and is seen as a bargain, with some rather authentic Asian dishes."

The servers were fantastic, really attentive and quick to bring drinks and food out aswell as not pestering you to check everything's ok every 5 minutes, really refreshing. The food I'm going to say was stunning to look at, the presentation was fantastic on each dish, however for me, the steak was slightly over, I prefer my steak with abit more blood, chips were stunning but a tiny portion, it came covered with salad which I found a strange accompaniment and the creme brulee was nice, however the flavour just was n't there for me, there was a ton of vanilla at the bottom but, throughout the rest it was odd, I could n't put my finger on the flavour. I'd come back but I'd try something else next time to add to comparison."

It's supply and demand of labour. Literally the most basic tenant of capitalism. 
This post points out that the requirements for the job aren't high. Sure. But yet we can't get enough people to apply for the job. So you have to increase incentives.  
Same applies to teachers. Want more ""better"" (not even going to delve into what better means or how you quantify that) PAY THEM MORE. 
It's not about making the qualifications easier or lowering the bar to entry. It's about making the job more attractive.  
We are happy to pay CEOs million to get the best candidate. I don't see the problem with apply this logic to cops and teachers and nurses etc.

Lemon lime and bitters drink in a parfait glass was cute but i think it was cordial and too sweet. The lunch special was tasty and plentiful. One person at the table thought the plate had sat on a bai marie for too long. Some of the plate was nt warm other parts too hot and the rice was stodgy. We took the rest home for anothers persons tea tonight. But overall we were generally happy and will definitely go again. Must book for lunch and dinner.

For mains we had steak and chips and Lasagne. We had 2x glasses of house red and white wine. Service was excellent. Owner was very friendly. Overall a very good experience for Italian restaurants. The total bill came to 66 which I find to be excellent value for money. If you like tipping for service take cash as this option is not available at the card terminal.

-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of ",1,"I'll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 
-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots
-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.
-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 
- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 
-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 
I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 
My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don't use it to date, it's frowned upon but once you get out there you'll meet people anyway. 
There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 
I am an introvert so it's perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 
I am not single luckily, I wouldn't want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 
There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it's so toxic. 
Go meet people in real life, they tend to be more genuine."

The high price means that smokers will buy illegal tobacco, and so hence it creates the market for illegal . It's the same as perfume or designer handbags. They are 5000% markup . Criminal counterfeiters can see they can make money on that 5000% differential and the difference is enough to make it worth the risk.
I like the New Zealand approach. The government also wants people to stop smoking and so they just raise the age of smoking every year. Eventually after a few decades there are zero smokers. The price of the tobacco is reasonable and so there is no market for the criminal gangs to make a profit with illegally important tobacco.
Both schemes achieve the same thing . The Australian approach is really quite dumb, compared to the New Zealand approach."

Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.
Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.
Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. ""The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,"" Ms King told the Financial Review. ""The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered."" Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those  14 small projects worth about $444 million  were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory's election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money  about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers' third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor's signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money  about $136 million  went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to ""bail out"" Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. ""It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,"" Senator McKenzie said. ""This government spreadsheet has only one colour, and it's a sea of red."" stashes away billions for road and rail project announcements ahead of federal election."

The cold drink was a bit of a deal breaker because pepsi is bad and tastes weird and also I feel the cup quantity for 50 rupees is not worth it. So I will suggest adding more cold drink options like coca cola, sprite, etc."

Sure, similarly expensiv",1,"Heard this was Rockhampton high-end dining, but ended up very disappointed. Sure, similarly expensive to nearby restaurants and similarly substandard too. Not sure whether they're trying to go fine dining, family-orientated, or small business-like. They fail in any category. Food is not terrible. In fact it was n't bad by my taste. Still far, far below my expectations for what I was told was fine dining. Some elements did not seem very freshly made. Summing, poor quality control. Served by a very polite waitress who tried her best and I can appreciate that. Not tablecloth, but you can not try themselves for not being trained. The atmosphere is terrible. I almost thought to call it rustic, but that's simply trying to reframe outdated and worn out.

A lot of people take issue with treating this as a fossil fuel subsidy, but I have been to corporate events in the mining industry where they are already discussing shifting on-site vehicles towards electric to save on fuel. Making them pay the same fuel prices as the rest of the country would only incentivise such shifts faster."

Service was okay, we would have hoped the staff helped recommended some dishes, but instead she stood there waiting for us struggling with what could be chilli or not, as our daughter ca n't take chilli. Let's just say that service woild be nice to have but not expected. During the seating, the staff were great. I loved how we were nearly finished with the meal, and we were the only table not offered dessert menu when every other table was offered this. We have also overheard that the dessert here was good to try. Guess we will never find out. Instead, we were told we have 10min left as there is a second seating after us. We were never told this when we were seated. Standing around waiting to pay the bill was a lengthy process. We expected two options, either pay at the table or pay at the counter as you leave. We typically do n't want to waste time so we always head towards the counter. Little did we know this counter was shared with the front desk serving customers entering the restaurant. So we have to wait for 2 parties to be seated before we could pay and leave. Would highly suggest separating bill payment and ushering incoming customers since there are more than enough staff. Food is presented nicely, however is very dear for the portion size. Wallaby dumplings, the meat was tougher than the standard consistency of dumpling meat, however tasted okay with the sauce. The duck pancakes was an interesting twist to Peking duck pancakes with smokey duck. This is something you should try if you come here. Pork cutlet was okay, a different twist to crispy skin pork. Market fish was trout, and as always with market price, was much dearer than we expected for two fillets. However the skin was nice and crispy. Vietnamese coffee did n't taste very traditional. Overall above average rating."

Just under a couple of kms from the National Highway, totally an option if you want to dine in a fine restaurant. The food was too good, be it the starters or the main course. The service was pretty decent. The starters came in quick time but the main course took a while. This is a bar and restaurant and understandably, the milkshakes were not the best. They do have a pretty decent parking space and the facility, well maintained. The price is a bit expensive but it's justified considering the taste of the dishes."

Screams and gibberish from  5 pm to the small hours of the morning. Then this person would get up - start their car and rage at the world. Then take off and disappear for the day. Found out later it was to avoid the social workers. We contacted police to do a wealth fare check but the person would turn the lights off and refuse to answer the door. The police would just leave. We called them more than once. The Ambulance would not attend as their was reason to believe that the person was aggressive and dangerous. Long story short it took 2 years before anyone would help this person.  Our health in that time deteriorated due to a lack of sleep. We were lucky to get 2 hours sleep. What worked was to get in contact with the local public mental health services.

They were still 3rd behind AFL and League but the fact they drew a world record rugby crowd at Stadium Australia in 2000 (109k - still don't think it's been beaten) and 2003 World cup having one of the highest Audiences for a live sporting event proved it was a serious third code. 
Thing is this came at a time when league was in dire straights (Super league debacle) and we had a once in a generation team. After we lost the 2003 World cup, that *should* have been the point where the ARU went hard on developing the grassroots game and making an engaging domestic competition that was free and accessible. This could have ensured at least some success and interest going into the 2010's. 
Except they didn't do any of this, they let the grassroots wither on the vine and put the domestic competition behind a paywall. The result is what we have now, a shitty team with little interest and a dead domestic league. The ARU is mostly staffed by private school boys who are too busy sucking each other off over how great they are instead of developing the game as much as possible. As an ex private school boy it's disappointing seeing the game I love become completely irrelevant but at the same time I also kinda love seeing the cunts fail in utterly humiliating fashion. The NRL is what competence looks like, at least in terms of sports administration."

She put us on a table right next to the toilet away from others, up a step and away from the nicely set tables. Our table had any old serviettes where other empty tables were red and beautifully folded. There were filthy windows at the back of restaurant to one side of us. Huge cobwebs hung at the side of fireplace where a skirting board held it up along with cobwebs between a Christmas tree and storm lamp on the fireplace-it is now May! There were Christmas lights on the logs in the fire well. The fireplace itself looks like it came out of a local dumpit site. This place did not have any of the drinks I chose-medication stops me having alcohol, so I had to have water. My caprese salad came without balsamic vinegar so I got up to ask for it. The lasagne was 2 inches square-the smallest I've ever seen!!! It was swimming in tomato sauce. The penne dish went cold quickly and was soon dried up. When the food arrived the waiter shouted at us not spoke, then thanked us in GERMAN ? ? ? We are Yorkshire through and through. We had to get up again to ask for desert menu and chose one but could we have two spoons please. The waitress forgot what we wanted so came back. When we went to the bar to pay, the bill was not ready. Some tables were still not occupied when we had finished. We were glad to leave."

I can only think there are three possible policy avenues.
Firstly is bribes for state governments to loosen zoning restrictions. Unlike many here, I question how effective this will be to solve the crisis. No doubt it will impact some local markets heavily, and have a moderate downwards pressure on rentals over the long term. But solve the crisis? I doubt it. 
Secondly would be the classic housing subsidy program. The sort of thing we've seen fail again and again. 
Thirdly would be social housing spending. Which would'merely' move to slowly and slightly solve the housing crisis of rental costs of the bottom 10% of households. 
The thing about this crisis is that it's a structural issue. It's going to require radical reform to address in any significant way. There will have to be losers (land owners). But neither major party is politically capable of delivering this."

Extras, like gravy did n't arrive, we were told several times that it would arrive in one minute, but never arrived. We were never asked if everything was okay, infact we had to all but pin down the staff who did their best to avoid us. In summary, food was very expensive and poor quality, we could have gone to several different pubs in Scarborough and paid half price for the same type of food menu. If you like overcooked and overpriced food, give it a try. I certainly would n't recommend this place."

Cmon. Let's get real. They would rather absolutely f*ck the future generations if it means they don't have to pay an extra $200 a year on taxes. 
Neoliberal hyper-individualism has completely wrecked this world and until all the selfish oldies die out. There's not much that can be done. Raising taxes is political suicide, advocating for the youth is political suicide. The Boomers and Gen Xers would rather live as luxurious as possible knowing they will die before suffering the concequences of their greed."

I apply to so many jobs and don't even get the courtesy of a rejection email, I knew it was over for me when I done a day's work for a job trial and then got left on seen when I asked if I got the job or not 5 days later. 
Honestly it's made me feel so completely and utterly useless, my parents are so disappointed in me. I don't leave the house because it costs too much money, I don't even get Centrelink because my parents think it's only for dole bludgers. 
Sorry this was a rant but still it's good to know people feel the same way <3"

Starting with the positive, prices are super competitive, most dishes are under 16. However, moving to the negative, dishes are on the small side, my kids and wife( not big eaters) asked to stop at a bakery after our meal as they were hungry. We also felt quality of food could have been much better. A few examples:-The cinnamon toast was flooded with butter, we could n't finish it.-Poached eggs on the Benedict were over cooked( like hard boiled egg)-Dishes were all super basic in execution, an average home cook could have easily done a better job. To top it all, we set outside in area which was nice enough but swarming with flies. I reckon the restaurant can do much more to deal with that, it much more than small nuisance "

No one is going to say ""x race need to stop committing crimes"" .. ""x ethnicity need to stop abusing their children"" for fear of falling foul of racial hatred laws.
>*section 18C makes it unlawful for someone to publicly ""offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate a person or group of people""*
But every day we hear that ""men need to stop raping women"" .. ""men need to stop abusing women"" to the more extreme ""kill all men"".
Personally I'm offended every time I'm told to stop abusing women because I possess a dick, I'm offended that being masculine has been intertwined with a hateful term ""toxic masculinity"". Would be interesting seeing some ""incels"" take this to court to prevent offense and insult. 
Will these laws finally end the double standard we have around what is ""hate speech"" for race, but ""acceptable commentary"" when it comes to the (male) gender?"

Not sure how the safety argument applies. If they have been sentenced they are in prison. If they've served their sentence, then we don't have an issue (unless you think the sentence is less than it should be, in which case this also applies to Australian criminals).
Deportation, if you think it's a safety issue, just puts the problem on another country's hands. It's called bad behaviour if you shove your own problems onto others."

If any government unilaterally cuts immigration, they will be attacked in the press and the opposition will be put in. Though the voters largely want to see significant cuts in immigration, the voters have very little control over the immigration numbers. The lack of a structured immigration debate during elections and the absence of any election promises on immigration largely leaves the door open for governments to do what they want irrespective of public opinion. Labor seems especially good at pretending that they had absolutely no control over the immigration surge, though every single immigrant who came in was granted a visa by Labor."
