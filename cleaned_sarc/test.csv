Not too much availability of every items in menu all the time. Cons: hospitality of staffs and manager not up to the mark compare to any popular resturant. They are very casual and not attentive towards customers. I personally feel this quite awkward. Overall they are good. You should visit to taste their dishes.

The service was good. The food was delicious. Waiters were keeping track of when your drink is finished and needed to refill it. The washroom was a bit uncleaned. Attached is the menu for drinks from the AC section. Rest I will recommend visiting the place.

We were a little irritated but again dint want to spoil our mood for a dinner. Calicut is know for its different varieties of food served, halwa, juices, and snacks. We stopped near Dakshin, which when enquired with friends, many of them suggested the place. We had to wait for some empty seats, self service it was, making the order took some time, then waiting at the counter for the food also took sometime. The food was ok there, I thought the hype was a little more for that place. Porotta were good, kerala porotta( how can it be bad). It was served with channa masala, and then dosa and tea to end dinner. I would search for better places here and I am sure there will be many more in Calicut."

There were 3 of us, but they only gave one small serving of bread and salad. We were meant to eat the bread with mayonnaise as opposed to humous. My aubergine said it comes with salad and rice. I got the rice, but the salad was apparently the salad we initially received with the bread. The waiter was very rude when we enquired about the salad as I am a salad lover. We were very disappointed. The chicken donner was not spiced up, just served as it is. All in all, the experience was n't worth the money we paid. I am NEVER going back."

The AWU don't do it, they instead also get assaulted by the CFMEU.
No other union is this militant, even the ETU. 
Remember when the CFMEU exhibited truly blue collar values by backing domestic violence enthusiast John Setka, in his comments against Rosie Batty? 
Remember how the union rallied behind Setka in reaction to the now-PM seeking his expulsion from the Labor Party?
Setka's VIc branch is already extending into ACT and SA. 
I know for you PINOs, mindless backing of all unions is what you do to avoid being accused of being anti-worker as your politics aren't based on conviction but on status and conformity and inclusion. You can be pro-worker and conclude the CFMEU are a massive problem for Australia. If even parts of the Labor Party are worried about the CFMEU's unhinged militancy, you know there's a problem. What will it take - wives and kids of building firm employees disappearing before people realise that it's an issue? We know you CFMEU fans are ok with domestic violence so it's useless to ask about *that*."

What's happened since isn't so much a relaxation of standards as much as they just haven't been able to control content online. As the eSafety commissioner demonstrates, Australia hasn't lost the desire to regulate content for dubious moral reasons.
Any efforts to install online age verification, which in turn requires identity verification, are likely to reinvigorate the Australian government to try and censor pornography. Imagine pornhub with half the categories removed because they are abhorrent to Christians and feminists."

The Liberal/National Parties and Australia's corporate media repeat and amplify whatever lies and propaganda their donors/advertisers pay them to.
Let's call it what it is - blatant corruption.
The mining and fossil fuel industries paid the coalition and News Corp to push nuclear propaganda for the last few years despite all of the scientists and engineers in the energy field stating unequivocally that nuclear power is not economically viable in Australia.
We need media reforms to sever the control of corrupt billionaires on the public discourse, and to restore the independence of news and journalism.
An independent media will then report on and expose corruption in our political system, which is the news media's role in keeping democracy healthy."

The toilets were absolutely disgusting. Gag worthy. The one cistern was blocked and the one one urinal was not in good shape. Smell was horrendous. It took over ten minutes for our order to be completed. Seemingly a grilled chicken salad is not a staple order here as it took an eternity to make. Looked terrible and whilst it was being made everything else went cold. Terrible. Wo n't be back here.

They also advertise that you get a great seat and free chocolate etc. None of this was realized at all. We had the table right at the entrance, which was not a great place at all and there was no other attention to the birthday. Why do you promote this and yet 0 is implemented ? When the food arrived, we were disappointed once again. My partner ordered the steak medium rare and got a steak well done... in a steak restaurant you expect that the cooking levels should n't be a problem and that they know their way around. He had to give the meat back and I had to eat it once because otherwise it got cold. Great to celebrate a birthday in the restaurant and I ca n't even eat with my partner at the same time. Then his food arrived( when I had almost finished eating) and the meat was only cooked medium. absolute disappointment Dessert: when we got the dessert menu we had to wait over 20 minutes to be able to order. We then got fed up and got up and paid without ordering dessert. We've been to various steak restaurants all over the world, but we definitely would n't go to this one again. The food was ok, but there is definitely better!"

I recommend calling in person to find out if window side tables are available as it's directly across the road from the river & the earliest bookings get priority unless they request otherwise. I ordered a half pepperoni and half chicken supreme pizza, my wife ordered the bolognaise with pasta.. which came with chopped chilli & flakes of I ca n't recall which cheese in two separate bowls. I loved the pizza, I got large as if ask for half & half it has to be a large I was told.. no problem cos what you do n't eat you can just have put in a takeaway box. My wife bolognaise was a generous serving, though for my wife it was a little light on the pasta and the cut chilli brought out with it had no zing at all, she loves chilli so she knows her chilli, yet these are personal taste factors, Other than that we had no complaints at all.. waitresses were polite & friendly and work very hard. I would recommend this restaurant for a nice meal, great value for money and a nice friendly, vibrant atmosphere"

The problem is that despite Aldi or IGA's often having better deals, I can't do all my shopping at those places so I tend to end up at the big 2. I already know they're ripping me off but I don't have time to drive to 3 different places to get all the stuff I need. I don't usually have time to get just to my closest Aldi. And *the big 2 know* this too. They know I'm gonna grumble then pay their shitty prices.
More evidence isn't going to help."

More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some ",1,"Wow, what an experience. More than an hour wait for our breakfast but we probably need to take some of the blame as we ordered an extravagant menu choice of bacon and eggs with a hash brown. No greeting or instructions, so we grabbed our own table and waited. Fifteen minutes later it was obvious that we probably needed to get our own menus as there were none on the table. Menu collected and choices decided, went to the counter to order and still no greeting apart from a couple of grunts whilst coffee was being made. Order provided and more than an hours wait for food to arrive. Underwhelming at best. Packaged butter placed on the balsamic glaze to make the experience all that much better with sticky fingers. Buttering the toast was an experience as there were more holes in the bread than bread. A request for salt and pepper was met with a look of distain. Again, I should have trusted the chef in such a quality establishment to season the food sufficiently. Bacon was ordinary, hash brown flavoured with three month old oil but my poached eggs were near perfect, hence the two stars. One for each egg. Do yourself a favour, go around the block and take advantage of Maccas or Hungry Jacks. At least you know what you will get there."

Although my recent experience might not have been perfect, I'd still rate it a solid 4 for several reasons. First, let me address today experience. We ordered Dragon Chicken, and it was a bit tougher than usual, not meeting our expectations. The Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was decent, but the Oriental Chicken dish was unexpectedly spicy, making it a bit challenging to enjoy. However, the reason for my 4-star rating lies in the consistent quality of food I've enjoyed in the past at Second Wife. The Kebabs, in particular, have always been a highlight, with their delicious flavors and perfect texture. This restaurant has been a reliable choice for tasty food, and I hope that today experience was just a one-time hiccup. I'm looking forward to returning for their delectable Kebabs and more in the future."

The current reality is: yes, you are worse off *if you view strictly through the prism of ""how much can I flog my home for later?""*
If you value other aspects (convenience, lower price, location, not needing a backyard and etc) then the equation changes, but since a majority of the economy is tied into ""homes increase in price"", state govt gets most of its income in ""homes increase in price"" and most of the media literally has a stake in ""homes increase in price"", then you have the current reality.
Strictly focusing on detached homes as the only options mean transport and services struggle to scale and serve the new areas, this has been a known problem forever as well.

The undergraduate and destructive stance taken by Greens leader Adam Bandton the October 7 terrorist attacks byHamas against Israelis proof enough of the harm the far-left party poses toAustralia's community cohesion
The inflammatory detour into foreign policy is calculated to embarrass Anthony Albanese but, as outrageous as the anti-Israel stand is, it is only part of a bigger threat that the Greens represent to our national identity and good government. When allowed to get close to the levers of power  as they did in de facto coalition with the Gillard Labor government, and with a balance-of-power position in the federal Senate today  theGreens are exposedfor the wreckers they are.
The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy  most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups  has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation's environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.
Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government's corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.
The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government's wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression. The Greens, once again, have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions."

Gail Bakery is a curious nook in Altrincham town center that'll have you hooked and wanting to come back for more!

However, if you prefer basking in the sunlight while munching on your treats, you'll have to roll the dice with the weather. Outdoor seating is a fair-weather friend, but when it cooperates, it's a treat! Attention parents, mini-humans are welcome here! The vibe is kid-friendly, and it's a decent spot to enjoy breakfast with your little ones as long as it's not peak hour madness!

The population for 2 years has been saying to do something about immigration/cost of living. They havent gotten on the front foot and shown they are doing something. 
A bit like ScoMos fire blunder. Cost of living was a major issue and he had The Voice. That died down and he stopped tradies from coming and ramped up immigration. They had a big argument over some minor changes to taxes that everyone wanted indexed anyway. He was given benefit of the doubt and now he has come out with a inflationary budget. People are saying when is he going to do something about cost of living.
Im not saying he doesnt care or he isnt doing anything. Im talking about the spin. He needs to recover the frame that he is the one to be voted in to handle cost of living. Thats always going to be a little tough for the ALP due to peoples perception as the LNP being better at managing the books. But him leaving it for so long hasnt given people confidence. He is running out of time. Because now anything that takes more than a year like essential infrastructure to improve housing supply is too late.
Now he is done with another budget. So he only has the one just before the election left which is too late. 
Dutton has come out with a major decrease to immigration which a lot of the public perceive as being a silver bullet to cost of living (I dont personally agree). That has really put Albo on the back foot.
As I said with no budget until just before the next election he doesnt have much of a chance to reset the publics perception. The media will keep piling on with the landlord/private jet/out of touch stuff and Dutton will keep quiet. QLD a major swing state also has a crime problem and an ex police Qlder will probably do well.
I still think Albo can win a majority but he needs something big to turn it around. Like a bushfire/refugee boats/covid that can be used politically to readjust perceptions. Otherwise its going to be a coalition with Greens/Teal or a slight Liberal victory."

Was greeted immediately and I knew what I wanted already. Had a Lamb Shish with rice but it was without asking served with a bowl of side salad, bulgar wheat, fresh pitta bread and the chilli sauce tasted splendid. The lamb was cooked to perfection and each piece tasted as tender, juicy and succulent as the last. The rice was the perfect accompaniment to this dish( as opposed to just the pitta or chips) it was ' warming ' and had a gentle, buttery taste. Interior was simple, yet beautiful; a modern and classic mixed look. There even a veiled prayer booth / section at the back; now you may not pray( or be of the Islamic faith) but the addition of such a room was thoughtful-and it blended in and added to the whole ambience. Very competitively priced for a passing lunch-recommended."

The food is absolutely smashing! A great selection of really tasty, decent sized meals at surprisingly reasonable prices! They do some great deals that include a 3 course meal and a drink for 35( at mar 2024) Atmosphere in the restaurant was really nice... Seemed to be a lot of bigger groups like ours I imagine doing similar things with work. Service was prompt and good. I have never really been in the casino bit properly before now, and it was really busy. The free bet you get with your meal is restricted to a few of the slot machines around the edges rather than the table games, so it was a bit weird to me, watching all these elderly people feeding their pension into slot machines, but if they're enjoying it I suppose we all have our vice! Free parking right next door is an absolute bonus and despite how busy the casino was there's plenty of room."

This pub main selling point is the stunning view of the Liverpool waterfront through the windows and watching the ships go by. They had a reasonable range of beers to suit most tastes. We ordered our food but had an hour wait for the meals to turn up. I tried the Sticky Sesame Chicken and it was worth the wait as all the meals were very good. The staff very pleasant and helpful. Meals were good value for money.

Situated diagonally opposite to the famous Kaanch mandir, this small shop is Indore hidden gem for sandwich lovers. It sells unexpectedly good. Generously layered with Paneer cubes, capsicum, onion, cucumber and some tandoori mayo, these sandwiches are huge. It would n't be wrong to call it a huge club sandwich. Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well. Check out Madhuram Sandwich when you crave for a great sandwich the next time and sink in this delicious street delicacy. Enjoy!"

By all means have a support person there too. 
I personally would not expect to be paid extra for this sort of meeting especially after not notifying Woolies at an appropriate time about being sick due to sleeping in...and I certainly wouldn't be looking for clauses in an EBA to justify a 10 minute meeting and looking to be paid 3 hours minimum for it! Contacting fair work too? If you spent this time being productive who knows what you could achieve.  Unbelievable 
Sounds very entitled and painful to be honest. If I were the manager and faced with these expectations I'd probably give shifts to the more organised and less demanding staff. The last thing I would do in your position is rock the boat if I wanted to keep my job. 
If I were your colleague I would be furious that you want  to get paid 3 hours extra for a meeting that would never had occurred in the first place had you done the right thing and that I have to pick up the slack too... I'm sure in the EBA it is a requirement to call in sick at a certain time. You can't pick and choose which parts you agree with grow up!"

What an odd thing to say. Then again, openly admitting that the property market is distorted in the sense that somehow high prices due to constrained supply and increased demand did NOT increase firms into the market to take advantage of higher prices (as econ tells us), and therefore increase supply of housing, was just a humble brag to say they're in command and making money at our expense, as you pointed out."

However when I had to continuously wave my hands at the waitress too busy looking at her phone and talking into her watch to serve me there's an issue. The staff member did n't seem to care at all. She said sorry in a smart tone. I think her name was Jas or something. The food was decent and the only reason I've given any stars. Staff who care about their customers make a difference. More training might be needed or better management of staff and smart watches.

Went down with my life, little girl( 2) and our friend with 2 kid",0,"First time at Neighbourhood today. Went down with my life, little girl( 2) and our friend with 2 kids of her own. Pretty busy as expected for a new business in a good location outside of the Warragul CBD area. Greeting from staff was great and welcoming after we managed to wind our way through the tables to our booth seating. Young lady who served us was very attentive and made sure she got our orders correct by reading them back. I appreciated this very much. Our coffee came out first, I ordered a vanilla latte and was unfortunately disappointed with the temperature and the flavour. Overboard on vanilla so tasted like sweet milk more than coffee. I ordered the breaky croissant, my wife poached eggs on toast with avo and hashbrowns, and we got our little one a cookie. Cookie passed the test with our 2 year old. My wife was disappointed with uncooked poached eggs and overly seasoned avo on a single piece of crunchy sourdough. Add on the hashbrowns that actually tasted like springrolls( fry oil clean), and you have an unhappy dining experience. Breaky croissant, I have not much nice to say unfortunately aside from it was hot. Toasted closed, so it was very burnt outside and lost most of my croissant on the plate. Ca n't fault the service today, was quite quick to bring out food and the wait staff were polite, accommodating, and friendly. Finish up paying the check with a shock to having paid 7 for the cookie and a total of 55 for not a great product. Could have been and did expect a mich better overall experience at Neighbourhood today. I am debating about going back.... I think one more attempt is warranted."

When we arrived",0,"We booked a table for 7 pm as we know it can get busy here, especially on a weekend. When we arrived 5 minutes before the hour, our table was n't ready, understandable as we were early. This was n't a huge issue as we got a drink and sat in the bar area, however, we had still not been seated by. We asked a member of staff how much longer we would be waiting, and conveniently the table was ready straight after asking, with no apology for the delay. There was a live singer which was a nice addition to our experience, however, we were unfortunately seated in the small side room( with around 5 tables) near the entrance, away from the main restaurant and the better atmosphere. We could hear the singer, but would have preferred to be in the main restaurant. We love that this place offers both spanish and cuban tapas as well as other main dish options. To eat, we opted for some tapas dishes so that we could share them. We ordered; the hummus, chorizo lollipops, roja vieja, seabass, verdura jambalaya, belly pork and patatas bravas. The portions were of a good size and nicely presented. Most of the food was really tasty as well, although we did feel that the batter covering the chorizo lollipops was very soggy and quite bland. The hummus definitely needed another slice of bread for the amount of hummus. The roja vieja tasted absolutely amazing, the beef was cooked to perfection with so much flavour, however, this was only served with one small taco, which meant as we were sharing( which is what most people do with tapas) we had to half the taco meaning there was loads of meat for only half a taco. All of the other dishes were up to a great standard. This visit was n't our first to Qubana and it wo n't be our last, but we hope that next time we will be in the main restaurant."

The management team was extremely accommodating of our needs and allowed me time to set up the tables and area of dining how I wished. Provided me with an extra table for the cake. We pre ordered our food, which made the evening run amazingly, and the bill was paid before the guests arrived. It's definitely an easier way to do it. The staff who served us were also extremely efficient, and food came out at great speed when needed. The manageress attended to us so well even when there was a small issue with a meal. I personally spoke to her at the end of the evening and gave my personal feedback, which she took on board. I would point out that the One star review awared by another guest, my father, was unjustified and not a true reflection of the whole night. We will come back to this restaurant as its now our 3rd or 4th visit. Yes, some improvements are needed, which I again addressed, and I hope they are sorted out. Its a great location and I wish the restaurant all the best. See you again soon"

The staff were nice and friendly. The food took a while, and I nearly just left, as I would have been late for my meeting, but it then arrived. The English breakfast was underwhelming, with half of it cold and not particularly appealing. It was probably just the time, but I will go elsewhere next time."

Flavourz cafe is great for a 99 ice cream and sit in their deckchairs in the sunshine. There is usually some kind of event on. Today there is a German Oktoberfest beet festival.

The dynamite shrimp was nice, and the pieces were big, but the masala I forgot to take a picture of were meagre. The Dum biryani was just-and the Szechuan noodles were also fine. But the chilli garlic prawns were SO underwhelming with barely any flavour in the gravy, and the white rice I ordered was stale and hard to eat. I think this Indo-chinese place struggles with the "" Chinese "" parts of the menu. They probably benefit from cutting down some of the many options and polishing the popular items."

He was a Keynesian. Meaning he used government spending to maintain full employment. When inflation increased he raised taxes to reduce it. 
When inflation was low; government spending was used to lower unemployment. 
Quite high tariffs were used to protect Australian industry and agriculture from foreign competition and to allow domestic wages to not have to compete with foreign workers. 
Also another discordant note. He boasted about building even more public housing than the Curtin government. It was a key policy in ensuring as many people owned a home as possible.

I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.
I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.
Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 
As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes be leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.
If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?
Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush."

We sat at the tables outside which could feel a little squashy and they forgotten to give my sauces with my order. It definitely not cheap but portions are generous as are the amount of lemon wedges they give. Drinks and extra sauces are sold separately which can all add up at the end. When did sauces get so pricey at 3 each ? Other than that it was a good meal.

Before I went to university I took a few years off and worked in Italy when we were still in the EU, well that's all finished now so I don't see a future for myself in the UK as it's no longer a base through which to access Europe. My original plan was to work in the UK for a couple of years and then look for work in maybe France or Germany because why not, but that's become so much harder so I'm looking at New Zealand or Australia when I graduate.
It's common sense. This country doesn't value young people. Why would a 20 something with a valuable degree stay in the UK and have stagnant wages, shit pensions, crappy housing?
My brother is doing his doctor training at the moment and he's decided to stay in the UK because he loves the NHS and wants to give something back which is very noble. But for someone like myself who has had their life fucked by 14 years of tory bullshit and Brexit I see no future in the UK."

The irony of someone associated saying this without some degree of analytical backup is hilarious; folks looking for their first home would probably agree, those renting/looking for the next one would also agree (aka the demographic that has been ignored for the last few decades), those who just bought a home and getting hit with the reality of ""sometimes rates go up"" would agree, however those either fully paid off mortgage wise, or majority paid off I struggle to believe have the same sentiment as they would be pushing for their investment to drop in value.
Past that; again, immigration has only been a ""big issue"" the last 2-3 years or so, and to say house prices (especially relative to wages) were at all healthy pre-2020 is just gaslighting people.
Dropping immigration to 0 might help house prices a fraction, but the core system that sees the median house price grow faster than wages will still be in place, so we'd probably slam into a harder rescission and then people would have less borrowing power and have less purchasing power anyway."
