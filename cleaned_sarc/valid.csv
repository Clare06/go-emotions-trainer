There was even a letter bombing campaign in the UK  by Zionists."

The main takeaway I have, and I'd assume the same for Berlin is that we're talking densely populated cities which actually have cycling infrastructure physically seperate from vehicular lanes, and certainly in Paris, the streets are narrow so cars are not travelling at speed. It's the direct opposite of here where cars travel at speed on the same roads as bikes. 
I'd love to cycle more places, but bike helmets aren't putting me off, it's the lack of a safe cycling route that won't leave me on a bike at the mercy of a dickhead in an unnecessary 4WD and potentially dead or brain damaged. 
Fix the infrastructure and maybe then we look at helmets."

While you are sorting out the schooling, we've recently found getting an in-classroom OT has been invaluable in linking the therapy goals and addressing the gap in the support needs being met.
I would also put in writing your concerns to the relevant leadership for your school (principal/head of learning), if your child has a diagnosed disability, regardless of NDIS funding, they need to be on an Individual Learning Plan, which outlines how the school will meet your child's learning and support needs. I wouldn't move your child without pursuing this avenue first."

Like they were told a million times; changing a grid which has been built over a century is no easy feat. Instead of incentivising the private sector the heavy hand of government has tried to tell us our power mix at a certain date in the future and failed. 
Now as a state we have to provide a profit guarantee to coal plant operators to make sure we don't end up in rolling black outs next summer.

It's equal to the nuclear or fossil fuel lobby paying GE for a report to justify the cost of nuclear. These are never commissioned to find facts, they are commissioned to justify an existing position."

Somehow had 2 beer and jumped out! Only to find out that the AC bar is opened! Since there was limited time, we went inside the AC restaurant but could n't find any waiter. When I checked in the reception, the lady said to have a seat. But I saw many clients sitting idle wairing for some one to attend. Thank God that we did n't wait. Else we would have missed our train at!!! The AC bar looked bit OK compared to the other one in the basement. Hope the management recruit few more staff."

Where has this come from? Seriously? It does seem to be something that's just crept into ordinary life over the last 10 to 15 years. Why? How?
This is such an American culture thing. This idea that we all have to ""protect ourselves"" from our fellow citizens. It's awful that this mindset has crept into our Australian society. This paranoia that everyone is out to get you.
It has to be stopped. This disordered thinking. How do we stop it?"

Service was very good with all the staff being friendly and attentive. Food was satisfying but the difference in dough between the garlic bread and pizza was a shame( or cooking style ? I do n't know). Either way the garlic bread was perfect and soft but the pizza was crispy and dry. If the pizza base was as soft as the garlic bread this would be easy 5 star. The cocktail was nice but a bit heavy on the soda I think as it was a bit watered down and the flavour went fast Good value nevertheless, would probably pop in for garlic bread and a drink."

I was glad that there were at least 8 touchscreen order machines in there and the one I used was very easy to touch. And the most important, I received my order in 7 MINUTES. This was the fastest service I received from Mcdonald in 2 months!!! The burger was warm and tasty, drink was good but just a bit disappointing that the medium fries only got half of the packet. I asked the staff to give me a cup of water and funny thing was the water had some Oasis taste with it. The toilet was relatively clean( quite impressed with the new flushing system). And a staff was just sweeping the floor and helped me remove the paper which stuck under my shoe. Thank you! In conclusion, I really enjoyed this meal!"

Parking area is big but we went by auto as it is surrounded by market place. Ticket is for 100rs for adults and 50rs for children below 12 yrs of age. There is a waiting area with many seats near the ticket counter where we have to wait after buying the ticket. Once there were close to 20 to 25 people, we are escorted by the guide inside who is a fort staff. We do not have to pay separately to guide. Fort is beautiful with amazing artwork.

Hey dude. You can find the GenCost report here: 
At the topic of page 32, the first sentence on the page, it says this:
> **Our approach is to include a largescale nuclear cost that represents the cost associated with a continuous building program.** Costs from new or sporadic national building programs are at risk of incurring FOAK premiums. While we recognise the likely occurrence of a FOAK premium, where possible, GenCost does not include them for other technologies not yet deployed in Australia and so does not intend to do so for largescale nuclear. South Korea was identified as the best representation of a continuous building program.
The cost is literally based on South Korea which has been building reactors since 1970. That figure is WAY undercooked and its still fucking ridiculous. 
Nuclear is massive distraction in this country."

>Labor is now resorting to baseless misrepresentation in a desperate attempt to distract from their shocking maternity failures. 
>Today, the Health Minister was caught covering- up the frequent bypass-closures of maternity services at multiple Queensland hospitals, including major service downgrades at one of the State's biggest hospitals on the Gold Coast.
>In Question Time the Opposition asked across the Chamber, surely the Government isn't asking nothers to delay having their babies, while they're transferred to other hospitals due to maternity closures? 
>With Labor suggesting women could just bypass their local hospital to go to another hospital to give birth, I could not believe Labor was telling mothers to ""cross your legs"" while in labour.
>This is the comment I made. 
>We have had women give birth on the side of the road in Queensland due to maternity services being closed in regional areas and this is what we were demanding the Health Minister answer for today.
>The comment was clearly not about the Health Minister, it was about the alarming Queensland Maternity Crisis, which continues to worsen on her watch and is putting women and children at risk. 
>Shannon Fentiman is aware I am a victim of domestic violence. She is also aware I am a mother. For her to mischaracterise my words for her own political gain and attempt to portray me as a misogynist is deeply offensive. 
>Labor has become so desperate due to their health failures that they will do and say anything to cling to power. 
>When Labor is backed into a corner, their true colours shine through. As the Health Minister and Minister for Women, Shannon Fentiman should be ashamed of herself.
>I am demanding the Health Minister apologise and admit she deliberately misrepresented Parliament.
Whatever views you may hold on the story now, at least it will be more informed."

Tonight it was blues rock by the newly formed Davey Pattison band. The venue is a windowless low roofed structure with a great stage with superb lighting. It has a sixties type club feel to it and still has a charge. Tonight was a ticketed concert and was sold out. There were expectations as this was Davey first home concert in some time. The mainly elderly crowd were not disappointed.

The reception team were n't particularly welcoming and it seemed to be an inconvenience for us to be there. We paid 82 for tickets and without rushing, we saw everything in just 45 minutes. Sure it's colourful and there are some interesting exhibits but such a quick visit is very disappointing for the cost of the ticket. The staff dotted around seemed passionate and knowledgeable, it's just a shame there is n't really a lot to keep you engaged."

Friendly and welcoming staff on reception and in the restaurant. The two lifts were slow, and while the breakfast did taste nice, it was small and was n't worth the 8. Room was decent size, warm, clean and the bed was comfy. Shower was easy to use, and a good temperature. Enjoyed the two slides of cake available to go with a cup of tea. Only downside for the room was the radiator( or something else) that was making cloud clicking noises all night, making it really hard to sleep. This may well just be a fault of this one room which is why I still rated the hotel positively, but I did need to get some sleep on the train back to London."

The beer garden is great but for some reason food was not allowed or being served outside today. I ca n't fathom why a pub would not want to serve food in their most popular area on one of the busiest days. To start off with, this is against RSA best practices and will almost certainly lead to more alcohol related incidents. In addition to this, they would have lost revenue and customers by not serving food where they were enjoying the venue. It's a great venue otherwise but this really let down the experience today."

The minute anyone proposes any decent change, the Shute shield clubs throw a fit. 
It also doesn't help that basic tickets to a test match are $100 minimum for decent seats. Myself and a mate of mine went to the England midyear test here in Sydney a few years back, and the tickets were 160ish a person. 
It's also the fact that rugby is not on free to air. There is almost no advertising for it. If you were to be asked who the wallabies are playing coming up, would you be able to answer. 
There is also almost no support for grassroots rugby. The number of smaller clubs that either fold or are forced to amalgamate just to be able to play is also a sad indication of where rugby is at."

You wouldn't be living in half the inhospitable states you live in if it wasn't for the infrastructure of the rail system, and once you've got that spread happening the movement supplies lends to pockets of towns in hospitable locations, places like Las Vegas. Secondly Las Vegas didn't just appear it came from the distinct need for gambling and prostitution and filled its niche run by gangsters willing to reap its benefits, same as your unions of yesteryear. You got a strange government that doesn't protect its citizens and the criminal underworld rose up and provided protection or availability until it became the snake that eats itself exploding with collateral deaths. Thirdly Las Vegas is built in a fairly flat spot and pretty tiny compared to our cities and in a thoroughfare, where as our uninhabited country is very hilly and very tropical and without thoroughfare, a real shit to develop."

Increasing their salaries only increases our inability to afford it. 
There is no doubt that we need to raise the minimum wage to meet the demands of the cost of living. 
$30 per hour is not unreasonable.
However you would currently after a 38 hour week receive 
$930 a week. 
At $29 per hour you would be getting $905 . 
If we just paid a basic minimum wage of $550 per week and a flat tax rate of 47 percent then we could actually pay people to look after our elderly at $20 per hour. 
Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 
Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 
People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don't spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset's and everything little things they earn. 
You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. 
Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don't. 
They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause. 
All fighting for their own patch of money and funding. 
Who yells louder and can wangle their political agenda. 
We have the one percent club on the television, pity these people are not in parliament."

Service was a disgrace with meals coming out at different times. I actually had to hunt down my big breakfast which was found to be sitting on the counter top in the kitchen. Certainly charge as though it is a top notch establishment but leaves a lot to be desired. We are locals by the way and wo n't be coming back anytime soon. Nice work Coffee Club

Very friendly and attentive staff who also had a good knowledge of the building history which was nice to hear. Went for a late lunch and took advantage of their fixed price two course menu, a couple of cocktails and some bread and olives. Very large bowl of olives which was nice, they were pitted and we do prefer non pitted as tend to be more flavourful, however these were still enjoyable and a good sized portion. Bread was reasonable but nothing outstanding. Bruschetta nice, sweet tomatoes and fresh, street pizza found a little sloppy and a bit bland personally. Mains an Arrabiata sauce they kindly changed penne to spaghetti for my partner, pasta nicely cooked, sauce could have used a little more chilli, simple but tasty overall. I had the Carbonara which tasted creamy but as I had a little bit of a cold I'm not sure if it actually had a touch of cream but it certainly was n't a full cream base which was good. I did find it although rich slightly bland in both the pancetta and the cheese, again I had a slight cold but expected the flavours to be a bit more punchy. Could n't manage a dessert but we did both go for a liqueur coffee, myself a Scottish and my partner an Italian, both were pleasant and well made. The two cocktails as well had a decent measure of alcohol, quite well balanced flavour wise and whilst I've had much better they were certainly enjoyable. Definitely would give it a try again, sniffle free to give a fair shot. The staff and the very reasonable price for lunch would make a visit attractive, but would also like to go for an evening meal and a more relaxed experience."

One wash was out of action so everything was slower. I was car 6 in the queue. About one week later I received a fixed penalty parking notice for 100. I appealed this charge and was given a warning that this was a courtesy that I would not be charged for staying longer than 30 minutes. Next time I would be charged. Needless to say there will not be a next time for this BP service station

Our immigration visas are already set up to only let on people who will benefit the economy. Visas are easier if they live in rural towns which have too many houses and not enough workers, etc etc."

It's honestly worth considering as it gives us a ""clean"" source of energy that doesn't rely on sourcing a ridiculous amount of technology from china, which could easily be pulled any time.
Whoever said nuclear required 6x as much water seems to have neglected the fact that seawater can be used for cooling, additionally If we were smart about it we could actually produce radiation free desalinated water with minor modifications.
Then again... The difficulty isn't building it, it's building it without blatant corruption and cost blowouts."

Who decides what is considered hateful, politicians with their own agendas who are bought and paid for, a corrupt, unaccountable and unelected civil service, or strange pressure groups that are bank-rolled by big business and shady individuals. That is a very slippery slope to descend, their have been cases where comedians and writers have been prosecuted for simply making a joke or publishing a work, their was a case recently were a man was arrested for placing stickers on lamp posts, again regardless as to how distasteful you find their statements and views, it's morally objectionable that people should be thrown in prison for simply opening their mouths and expressing an opinion. The most successful country on earth, the USA doesn't seem to be doing too badly with their guaranteed 1st amendment rights, we're increasingly seeing western ""democracies"" become more and more like 1984 as politicians try to cover their own failings with questionable legislation rather than address problems of their own making, I wouldn't be surprised if parliament rename themselves big brother HQ soon!"

Instead millions of dollars invested in new ones and stops. We've come too far now and there's this silly'biggest tram network in the world' pride some people have. Buses can go round things, they can pick people up from the kerb, they can be replaced when one breaks down. Trams aren't fast or frequent enough on roads with cars to replace car ownership, unless you plan on living in a 5km Melbourne bubble. 
London moves millions of people around Dickensian, two lane streets - they made hard decisions and put trains underground in London and run buses. 
All these sky rails are wasted spaces where houses could be to cope with the millions of new arrivals governments are bringing in to prop up our economy. 
It's cooked basically. Rant over."

Hmmm if only there were some guidelines and activity to filter out low effort comments and low effort complaining about sources they disagree with. Maybe, just maybe, space would be created for the adults. 
If only we could reach the lofty ideals of people either address(ing) the post in question, or ignore(ing) it. But maybe the observations of others are closer to reality than I want to admit."

Just abou,0,"I've always been a sainsburys shopper but the Loughborough branch needs some improvements. Just about all the trolleys have stiff wheels or make a racket. The lady on the self checkouts on Monday mornings puts a lot more importance on her conversation with friend colleague than customers, and you often have to wait at the self checkout for alcohol or whatever to be approved even when there are hardly any customers. This week I used self scan as usual and at the checkout it lost my entire shop. I tried to get the attention of the supervisor but she was chatting as usual so I wheeled my trolley to the kiosk but no one was there. I could have just walked out with my unpaid for shopping. I went back and interrupted the supervisor and told her what had happened. She was dismissive and said it had happened to someone else that morning and the only thing to do was to scan it all again. Bearing in mind it was all neatly packed into bags! Annoying enough but she was n't even remotely apologetic. Just went back to chatting. It's a good job for sainsburys that I have a conscience as I was so annoyed I felt like just nicking the whole lot. Shame because the produce is good, just some fairly serious customer service issues."

I have attached photos of how it arrived. I have not removed a beautiful lasagne topping as you would expect there simply was n't one. Nor have I mixed it up its genuinely how it arrived. It was n't sheets of lasagne, mince and beshmal sauce topped with melted cheese. It was simply mushed up pasta sheets and mince with burnt corners and hard over done bits of pasta. It was just about edible but a massive shame not particularly the most flavoursome either. It was very basic. I was expecting a lot more in terms of presentation and quality the reviews I've seen have heard fantastic things about this place but this was a massive disappointment. I never leave negative feedback and this is n't. It's simply an honest review of what I was given. It would be great to see the feedback taken on board and a genuine lasagne being introduced to their menu."

It's so frustrating. ALP would've been completely pantsed by now if they were the opposition continually contradicting themselves on numbers and putting out an uncosted pipe dream (nuclear) that they can't even get their own party to agree on.

The hotel needs a major makeover as everything looks old and the doors are old fashioned and probably repainted 15 times. Old wall paper in walls. The room was very small and not as expected for a double room we booked. Olivia at the front desk was very friendly and helpful. She did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable. Great outdoor sitting area too with parking on site. The hotel has great potential even though Southport is known for a more senior majority clientele. The location is absolutely amazing, in the heart of Southport on Lord. St and short walking distance to kings garden. Lots of shops around, supermarkets, coffee shops and restaurants very close to the hotel."

University is a class gateway
It used to be a stamp of approval that said ""yep, this guy's posh, he's one of the old boys, give him a job""
Then people saw that university graduates had better outcomes and thought it was something about university itself. So they started pushing loads of people through essay writing courses with no practical application
To be clear, I think education is valuable for its own sake. It's not inherently a waste of time to study something non-vocational 
But as an attempt to change society it kinda goes nowhere
So now that stamp of approval is meaningless unless it's from Oxbridge or maybe a Russell Group uni. It does however come with a shit ton of debt! 
I took out 9k per year for four years. That's 36k. I've been paying it off ever since. So now I only owe 64k. Great!"

Regular residents getting fed regular food so you don't have insane customers yelling at you about their madeup steak rules and no unexpected service rushes."

50k immigration isn't based on anything other than being a number you've plucked out of the air and feel would be attractive.  To put it into perspective, there are currently 57.500'spouse' visas available each year.  Your immigration policy is going to stop Australians marrying the people they  choose, all without even remotely coming close to addressing skills issues.  You've also just crashed the entire higher education system.  You have an interesting idea of'utopia'."

Deporting all their hardened criminals to our shores for us to deal with. It's a trick that ultimately goes against the interests of the Australian community even if it's emotionally satisfying."

I find the argument between cut and uncut is a very American argument personally and I see them bickering all the time about it. 
That being said:
Pros: 
-Easier to keep clean
-Not overly or under sensitive 
-Less chance for it to get caught on anything if I go commando
-Phismosis is not a concern for me
Cons:
-Looks dry compared to uncut
-Being middle ground on sensitivity means you can still feel negative things 
-See above, then add in the textures of the wrong types of pants
-More likely that if I get sweat pimples, they can form around and even at the tip at times.
Both sides of it have their ups and downs, but most women have told me they prefer cut because the idea of peeling back the skin to find something nasty beneath it due to the persons lack of hygiene is an ever present fear."

We complained then the meal got served along with the second drink after we said we were leaving. The wait was n't great, no one explained anything until we complained. After we finished eating the very bland food, we waited another 15 minutes before our tables got cleared. This was after the waiter passed our table several times without paying any attention to us. We had already ordered dessert along with the main meal  but we still had to wait again after our main dishes had been cleared to even get that. Not sure I ever be back after this encounter that has left me feeling annoyed by everything( the service & the food). Not great at all because I had lost all my appetite by the time dessert was served."

The food was quite dry and especially the muffin it was rock hard, I ate half and then gave it too the dog it was too hard to eat. I think the food needs to be thrown out if it sitting there too long. It also took an awkward amount of time for someone to acknowledge the fact I even walked in. I could see your busy but even a nod of the head would do. I just felt the atmosphere was loud and overstimulating, and if you do n't like that then this place is n't for you.

> 'Cross your legs?': Queensland parliament reacts in disgust to LNP politician's comment  video
Queensland opposition MP Ros Bates caused outrage in parliament after yelling'cross your legs' in question time. Labor health minister Shannon Fentiman wrongly accused her of yelling'close your legs', but parliamentary Hansard quotes her as saying'cross your legs'. Bates's interjection occurred after another MP asked Fentiman about patients in Brisbane being sent to a different hospital because of closures. Bates interjected by asking what the minister tells pregnant women during those periods the hospital was shut. 'Cross your legs?' she asked
While heckling at work would be a little frowned upon (it's not Question Time) it's a fair statement. If my boss told me I needed to keep a pregnant woman waiting even if she was going into labor, I'd say something similar."
